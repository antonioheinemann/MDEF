Travelling to el Hierro was a surreal experience. I got to know a new world that somehow seemed familiar, met amazing people and witnessed a wonderful lanscape of diviersity and thrive. This vieo is my documentation of the movement between mutuality. The dance beween polarities and the distinctions that are present in every aspect of life. I deliberately intend not to expand on the meaning, but rather open an invitation to reflection and introspection.
