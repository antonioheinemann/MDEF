## Critical Transfeminist Design

This seminar was interesting. Our instructor delved into the concept of a transfeminist perspective in design practice and its applications in experimental approaches. We explored the fascinating realm of Design Justice and examined our relationships with technology, as well as the implications for presence and absence. We critically examined power dynamics, addressing questions of subalternity and confronting the issue of epistemic violence.


One of the highlights of the class was when Laura presented captivating projects that intersected with biohacking, transhumanism, and transfeminism. Among them was a project that explored the transformation of humans into plants, blurring the boundaries between nature and humanity. However, the project that resonated with me the most was the bio-hacking endeavor involving a chip implanted in the hand, constantly monitoring the user's identity for safety purposes. Overall, the class provided an engaging space for intellectual exploration and challenged us to rethink our preconceived notions. Laura's expertise and the innovative projects she showcased truly broadened my perspective on the intersection of design, technology, and social justice.
