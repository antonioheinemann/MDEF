## Design Ethics

This seminar by Ariel Guersenzvaig was truly insightful and thought provoking around the role of technology in our lives. It has now become clear to me that technology is not just something separate from us; it is deeply woven into our existence. It is not neutral, nor does it determine who we are, but it plays a significant part in shaping our world. To start, I've come to question what really is technology and how simple or complex can it get. One crucial idea I've come to understand is that design is more than just creating functional products; it is a reflection of our ethical values. When we design technology, we must consider the impact it will have on individuals and society. Human knowledge, driven by our values, is essential for the development and responsible use of technology. It is often easy to overlook the influence of technology until it directly affects us. We tend to take it for granted until it becomes relevant in our lives.

However, technologies are not mere tools; they embody the values that a society holds dear. They actively shape the contexts in which we operate and influence our behaviors. I now recognize that technology is not limited to high-tech gadgets or complex systems. Even seemingly simple and ordinary things can be considered technology. For instance, we disregard the natural protection coat that nature has provided and place plastic wrappers to pacakage vegetables at the supermarket. We replace natural technology that works perfectly well with something that speaks more of modern civilization: plastic, short-sighted, unaware. Still, this design has a significant impact on our environment, consumer choices and overall human and planetary wellbeing.

Technologies play a role in mediating our perception and actions in the world. They shape how we perceive information, communicate with others, and navigate our daily lives. We must be mindful of the influence technology has on us and actively consider its ethical implications. This seminar has broadened my understanding of technology's significance and its intersection with ethics. I now see that technology is an integral part of our existence, materializing the values we uphold as a society. It is not a neutral force, not does it determine us, but it does actively shape the contexts and behaviors in which we operate. Designing technology ethically and being aware of its impact are crucial aspects that I have come to appreciate through this course.
