### About Me
## Antonio Heinemann

*Guatemala*


 I am a dreamer with an immense desire to enable, to transform and to improve. Others, the planet and myself. I wish to empower the collective and co-create a better world ~ one filled with mindfulness, presence, love and health for individuals and for other non-human species and ecosystems of earth. I admire authenticity and humbleness. My entire life has been a journey of understanding, expressing, and gratefully participating in creative processes that generate value or beauty. Especially, projects of social impact and those that foster the wellbeing and enjoyment of humans.

 I am now on a quest to create this envisioned future, and to evolve my understanding and potential to transform the world.
