### About Me
## Antonio Heinemann

*Guatemala*


Purpose driven, sensible, powerful and courageous. I am a dreamer, a thinker, and a leader with immense desire to enable, to transform and to improve. To empower the collective and co-create a better world. I am a fan of beautiful, simple and functional design. I admire authenticity and humbleness. I respect people that walk their talk and live by love. My entire life has been a journey of understanding, expressing, and enjoying. Across this journey, I came to recognize that my purpose is centered around creation. Whether in art, in life, or in business, I feel a deep urge to participate in creative processes that generate value or beauty. Especially, projects of social impact and those that foster the wellbeing and enjoyment of humans.
