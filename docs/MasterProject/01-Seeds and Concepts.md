### BioSensing
Designing a biofeedback device that measures and tracks physiological indicators associated with the different states of the nervous system can have a significant impact on an individual's overall well-being. By providing real-time feedback on the activity of the nervous system, users can understand how their body is responding to different activities, people, and environments, and make more informed decisions about how to care for themselves.

One of the key aspects of this device is its ability to facilitate communication and collaboration between humans and their own nervous system. By tracking and understanding the activity of the nervous system, users can learn to identify patterns and triggers that lead to stress, tension, or other negative responses, and take steps to address them. For example, if a user notices that their skin conductance increases when they're in a certain room or spending time with a certain person, they can make changes to their environment or relationships to improve their overall well-being.

In terms of career choice, the device could help individuals understand how different types of work and environments affect their nervous system. For example, an individual may discover that working in a fast-paced, high-stress environment triggers a "fight or flight" response, while working in a more relaxed, low-stress environment leads to a "safety" state. With this knowledge, they can make more informed decisions about their career path and work environment, and make adjustments to improve their overall well-being.

In terms of food, nutrition and exercise, this device could help individuals understand how different types of diet regimens and activities affect their nervous system. They can then use this information to make more informed decisions about what they eat, what types of physical activity they engage in, and how they spend their time. This is also a new way to approach health interpretation without idealizing perfect standards that are unattainable for some, and following what feels good for.


Another important aspect of this device is its ability to provide a new open-source perspective for research on the nervous system. Researchers in fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and medicine can use the data collected by these devices to gain a deeper understanding of how the nervous system functions and how it responds to different stimuli.

Overall, this device showcases potential for a powerful tool for individuals to co-create well-being with their non-human life by providing them with a direct line of communication to their own nervous system, helping them understand how different activities, foods, and environments affect them, and make more informed decisions about how to care for themselves. This device could be a valuable tool for research on the nervous system and stress-related conditions by providing a new open-source perspective.

This shapes a way of designing for regenerative futures because it empowers individuals to take a proactive and preventative approach to their own health and well-being.
