## MDEF Term I Journey

Constant change and reconfiguration are aspects of _regeneration_, and this has also been true for the last months and first term at MDEF. I’ve opened a door into a part of living with purpose that is new, exciting, confusing, and fun experience. From the design perspective, I am learning to navigate a new approach to seeing, creating, and participating in the world. I’ve also allowed myself to give shape to what is important to me, and the different directions that can give meaning to my everyday living. I’ve become educated in concepts that I perhaps should have been already more aware of. I’ve also connected with great designers and references that demonstrate an original and futuristic way to provoke thought and emotion. It certainly took some time to adapt to the change of hats and owning the ‘designer persona’ and the new framework to research, create and propose. Still, through intervention explorations I can now articulate that I am interested in exploring _*Regeneration*_.

Regeneration means designing not only to minimize negative impacts, but to actively restore and improve the systems depended on. It is a holistic approach that goes beyond reducing harm by focusing on creating positive impact and regenerating. Regeneration is about creating positive impact on the environment and promoting revitalization of natural systems. Yet, from a multi-scalar perspective, this definition can be also refer to natural systems or environments within us such as our nervous system or our microbiome. These natural systems play a fundamental role in evolution if a desired future of health, mindfulness and collectivism is possible. That is why I am focusing my projects and energy towards regenerative futures. I intend to explore ways in which we can heal and enjoy true wellness. To enjoy honest and revitalizing relationships with ourselves, with our community, with other non-human life, with all life. Perhaps it is not possible to change the world, but I am sure that great things can happen if we are emotionally free and act by love. These are some ideas that I am exploring and developing:


    -	Nervous System Biosensor: A device that uses available biofeedback technologies including HRV, respiration, skin conductance, EMG, and temperature to monitor and evaluate the different states of the nervous system. This device could be used for research purposes to indicate whether certain designs have a better nervous response than others. It could also be used for other research purposes that could provide insights in designing for safer spaces, relationships, dynamics, food systems and a wide range of stimuli.


    -	Education on Mind Matters: Transforming the individual could dissolve individualism and an ego driven evolution. Education plays a key role in this development and goes beyond the seeds planted at school or at home. We are constantly decoding different stimuli. I would like to create stimulations through art, through content, through video, through experiences. Provoke thought and reflection and provide a renewed vision of reality. I would also like to synthesize complex workshops on healing and design healthy and insightful ways to normalize regenerative practices and collectivism.






### New project goals:
1. Begin exploring with a design for the Nervous System biosensor.
2. Design an experiment with mycelium in two (or more) distinct environments. Document the evolution of the natural systems when exposed to positive and negative stimuli.
3. Design a workshop that synthesizes Zubieta’s Flowing Inside-Out 5 day workshop into an easy to digest 4 hour collective session.
4. Design a collective brainstorming session with different people interested in food and health to re-imagine and to co-create healthy convenience for the futures.
5. Explore with a communal education model that uses vertical gardens, neighborhood gardens or even plants or mushrooms as key resources.
6. Explore and have conversations around industrializing biomaterials and waste collecting systems.
7. Explore devices to measure and understand the microbiome, and seek for ways to DIY pre/probiotics or access biome regulating and regenerating technology.
