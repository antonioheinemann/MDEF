## Remixing Materials

Here is a presentation for our work in collaboration with Mark and Ramiro.

### Exploring Materials
_**Coffee Grounds from Nomad**_

<img src="https://antonioheinemann.github.io/MDEF/images/MT02/material.png" width="200"/>

**Properties (functional, technical & emotional):**

Earthy, granular, soft, stains brown.

Nutrient rich, making it a great substrate to act as fertilizer and a fountain for funghi to grow and thrive.



**Describe what it is and its aspect/aesthetic (add photo to documentation)**
**What is the story behind them (who did them, why, where did it come from?)**
Nomad is one of the best players in the coffee game. They serve some of the world's finest coffee, and even better, beans are roasted to perfection with methodologies of high grade. I am thankful to say that Nomad has a shop a few blocks from Iaac which makes me a frequent customer; much like the other millions of people that drink coffee every day. Even with its nutrient rich characteristics, this material almost always ends up as high quality waste in the garbage. The material in regard is grounded coffee that has already been brewed and disposed of.


**Applications:**
Ground coffee waste can be a sustainable biomaterial with potential applications in bioplastics, biofuels, natural fertilizers, and textile dyes due to its unique properties.





_**Bacteria, Funghi, from Prana**_
From the references, _Dasha Plesen. color studies_
This is also my ideal material.

**Properties (functional, technical & emotional):**

Living, fractal, geometric, spontaneous. Gives me joy, creativity and a burst of energy. Makes me reflect on the multitude of dimensions that exist in reality and our constant, yet ignorant, relation to them.  


**Describe what it is and its aspect/aesthetic (add photo to documentation)**
The material itself can be a multitude of vessels. Yet, the real material in regard is a forest of bacteria and funghi that coexist to illustrate all sorts of colors, patterns, ideas and expression.


**What is the story behind them (who did them, why, where did it come from?)**
Dasha Plesen is an artist from Moscow. She uses molds, bacteria, and fungi to create unique textures and patterns on various materials such as paper, leather, and textiles. Her work challenges what we consider beautiful and valuable, using often overlooked organisms to encourage us to rethink our relationship with the microbial world. One of her projects is called "Fungal Futures," where she creates intricate designs using fungi.

Bacteria and fungi are some of the oldest and most widespread forms of life on Earth, with origins dating back billions of years. Over time, bacteria and fungi diversified and adapted to a wide range of environments, including harsh and extreme conditions. Bacteria and fungi are found in virtually every corner of the Earth and have many important applications in human society.

**Applications:**
Audiovisual content. Videos, animations or photography. The results from bacteria are seducing and harmonizing. It could be a great application for any type of content really. It could also benefit from this format since it can be expanded in a live stream. Other applications for this could include prints of all sizes for decoration or visuals for design and art.
