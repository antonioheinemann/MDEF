## Electronics and Coding

For this assignment, we created a sound-producing device. It was an interesting exercise to continue understanding the basics of electronics and coding using Arduino.

I worked on the design for the board and for the code, taking into consideration the different components and how they would work together to create sound. I made use of different repositories online to find the right board pieces and code that would work for my project. I also had to follow specific schematics to ensure that everything was connected properly. As a result, the device managed to play the Star Wars theme. It was a simple but surprisingly fun exercise in understanding how hardware and software can work together to create a functional device.
