## Vision and Identity


I understand life as a Spiral in constant expansion. Time in motion as a driver for evolution. A dance, a movement, a spontaneous exgange of energy. I decided to use this symbol to express my Personal Development Plan for the master program. My knowledge, skills and attitude make waves that shape a spiral as it expands the person I dream to become in the future.

I am excited to become the person I need to be in order to shape the future I envision.
