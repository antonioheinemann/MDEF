## Tech Beyond the Myth

An exciting course on technology, hardware and electronics. We got together in teams to tear apart a broken printer so as to understand how the electronic device works through reverse engineering of its models, components, and systems. Through this exercise, we learned and explored first hand different concepts such as black boxes, electronics, breadboards, Arduino programing, power through hiding knowledge and right-to-hack.

It was an inspiring course to empower individuals to engage with technology in a confident way, even when having little knowledge about the subject. It was not only fun but also rich in content and highly engaging. The instructors were also through and provided great support.

After tearing up the printer, we then identified a number of components or systems that could be rebuilt, and then came about the design and production of a new electronic device. Although we had a wide array of components we could use, we quickly figured out that reconfiguring some of the components would be too complex and decided to keep it simple. We decided to use the power motors and sensors to create device that knocks doors. That is, when a sensor detects that the door is closed, it will begin to knock. When the sensor detects that the door is open, the device will stop working.
