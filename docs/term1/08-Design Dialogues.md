## An Expanded Vision

Through this first term of MDEF, I've come to redefine and expand what is important to me and the future I desire to live in. This new definition is influenced by the dangers of normalizing toxicity and a system designed to harm and to destroy. From the things we ingest, to the relationships we have with ourselves, others and the planet. The ways in which we invest and spend time. The limits that are pushed by the necessity to produce and make money to sustain any lifestyle. I've really come to question and rethink so many ideas through conversations, lessons and practice.

Normality in today's era:
- Supermarkets filled with toxic products rich in chemicals, additives, sugars and other highly processed ingredients.
- Fast food high in unhealthy fats and carbohydrates.
- Toxic and unhealthy convenience.
- Alcohol and drug filled entertainment.
- Producing for profit and not for a better world.
- Promoting emptiness and superficiality, seeking fools gold.
- Lack of awareness of damage to planet or living species.
- Ego driven society.
- Corrupt politics.  

Perhaps the reason why reality is as is, and what could lie ahead is alarming and frightening, is that we are damaged as a human collective. Society has inherited, and continues to evolve great trauma. Although mental health issues and psychology have always drawn my interest, it was not until this term that I really understood the relevance it has on modern development. I came to the realization that for any "good" to exist in life, there must exist a set of variables that enable humans to act in this favorable manner. That is, in order to create a better world, humanity requires to meet a set of criteria that enables this behavior.

Naturally, mental health is a key aspect in this conversation. Awareness, presence, gratitude, healing of trauma and making therapy accessible for all are proven concepts to increase wellbeing. If the human collective is healthier in this sense, then we could assume to see an increase in behavior that is good for people, living species and for the planet as a whole. Mindfulness, a connection with nature, and a sense of safety are also critical and relevant. Yet, not all determinants of this behavior are related to mental health or spirituality. Some are dictated by the system we live in, and by the thigs we have come to normalize (as described before). Others are dictated by privilege and luck, like having the time to meditate, or the money to purchase healthy food, or even the education we receive or the experiences we live through since birth.

Although this definition may be broad or vague, it is a starting point to define the type of behavior that I believe will be critical to create a healthy future. One where humanity ingests real food and convenience has been redefined to foster health of both humanity, other living species and of the planet. A future filled with opportunities to produce in a sustainable and regenerative fashion, where trauma has been healed and decisions are based on love, awareness and gratitude. One where humanity feels safe and rewires its nervous system to sustain social engagement, calmness, curiosity, openness, compassion and presence. If we are well, then we can create wellness and develop with a system that regenerates, heals, improves and enables.

My fight still contemplates health as a primary focus, yet expands its definition from purely medical to a more holistic and integral definition. Education and inclusion will prove to be critical aspects for this future scenario.
