This process involved a number of early mistakes which forced us to iterate two times to achieve the desired result. Initially, we mixed all ingredients at the same time while disregarding hydrophobic characteristics of corn starch. That is, the starch did not mix well which left lumps on the material. Although the result was not unatractive at all, it was not what we had intended so we decided to repeat the experiment. This next time, we made sure to mix the corn starch with water well before adding it to the large mix. This allowed for a much more smoother and uniform material.
