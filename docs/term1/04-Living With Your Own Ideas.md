## Living With Your Own Ideas

**What did you make? Why did it matter?**
Functional health considers diet and exercise as the keys to disease prevention and a life full of energy and possibilities. Yet, strict diet regimens and timed exercise are hard to follow and often require much greater than following a prescription. Even as a healthy person, I wanted to understand what it would feel like to be forced to highly structured healthy lifestyle. Moreover, I wanted to know what would happen if I attempt to understand my health by measuring it. So, I decided to understand what the day in the life looks like for a type 2 diabetic.

Diabetes affects the body by affecting the production and the resistance of insulin, which plays a vital role in health and wellbeing. Mainly, this hormone allows glucose (sugar in the blood ) to enter our fat, muscles and liver allowing us to produce and store energy. When our insulin becomes affected we need to help the body regulate the levels of sugar in the blood and we can do this through a balanced diet and exercise. When this combination is not enough, sometimes it can be necessary to aid our body with additional insulin so that we can continue to live functional and happy lives. High blood pressure can often come hand in hand with diabetes, and is something to monitor regardless of health status.

**What happens when you involve yourself?**
Things get personal! You face your fears and curiosities to greet them with open arms. There were so many feelings engrained to this process; pricking my finger, needles, sticky/uncomfortable tape, anxiety, isolation, disconnection, fear, peace, joy, comfort, gratitude. A lot of these feelings also had radical twists in short timespans, like before and after measuring my glucose or blood pressure. Not knowing if I may be indicating a health problem gives me fear and anxiety, but once I understand that I am healthy then I can enjoy life even more peaceful. New things that I never imagined also appeared in my head, a new universe that I had not yet discovered.

**What happens when you use yourself as an instrument?**
Intensity, detail and perception increase. Having interviewed a number of diabetic patients in the past, terms like lancets, test stripes, CGM, pump... were a standard for every conversation. But there is actually a huge difference in listening "I must prick my finger every night to measure my glucose levels, even if I use the CGM all day," and actually doing it yourself. The learning is much more profound and stimulating.

**Did anything change about your way of working? What does it mean for your future work?**
Yes. I've opened a door to get more personal, intimate and proactive to get myself into a great depth of detail that one can only obtain by immersing fully into the first person perspective. The journey was valuable and generated truly interesting insights. I believe that my work from now on forwards will have this pathway engrained, and that there will somehow be an invitation to explore the first person perspective.

**After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration?**

New concepts have emerged:
•	Pseudo-cyborg
•	Toxic Systems
•	Alienation / Unity
•	Mental <> Physical connection in health

Through this, I have also opened new research gates into the Central Nervous System, the Polyvagal Nerve Theory, Neurological Wiring and all of the different mental aspects that affect our health and ultimately all other aspects our lives.
