## Atlas of Weak Signals

This week has been one of the most profound moments until now. It’s in the beginning, where identity, purpose and vision are aligned forwards. This journey of introspection and ideation requires courage and creativity. The AoWS deck was a useful instrument to put into words concepts that are often complex and hard to express. When encountering a word I did not know, the images on the cards opened a space for imagination and interpretation. Moreover, it was surprisingly interesting how easy it was to use the cards to have deep conversations about topics that move something inside us. Creating a design space after this synthesized the entire knowledge acquired across the week; it was a surreal life exercise.

I was deeply moved by Mariana, her kindness and joyful excitement about MDEF. For reasons I can’t fully comprehend I was touched by hearing her personal story. Perhaps I connected personally with some of the feelings that she or others may have had to interact with in life. It has been hard for
me to reflect and write on how this makes me feel, I am somehow overwhelmed. All I will share is that I am grateful to be in this moment in life and learn from amazing human beings. I am grateful to be in this journey of self exploration, creation and evolution.

Narrowing down was a difficult task as I had many interests to explore. Yet, I managed to map three design areas:

HEALTH
⁃ Physical
⁃ Emotional
⁃ Mental
⁃ Energetic

NATURAL AND SUSTAINABLE
⁃ Recycling and reutilization
⁃ Reforestation
⁃ Ingesting real and natural
⁃ Regenerative

EMPOWERING CREATION
⁃ Open source innovation
⁃ Design for impact
⁃ Scalar Thinking
⁃ Maker mindset
⁃ Distributed design
