## Extended Intelligences

This brief course on AI and Extended Intelligences was really exciting and insightful. Not only did we learn the principles behind how machines think and the potential that awaits in the future of artificial intelligence. Being particularly interested in neuroscience and how the brain works, I was interested by the fact that artificial intelligence really mirrors the human brain in many ways.

I was amazed by all the references provided showcasing people doing amazing things with AI. Kudos to the Estampa for the shared knowledge, and also enjoy a space to share some of their inspiring work which was used as reference during the course.

The course was brief and came short on reaching depths to the complexity that is AI, it certainly sparked interest and became a door to consume deeper knowledge in the field. If at some point in my life I may have judged or misviewed AI, I now understand why I did so and how to make the best use of it for the future.

We played with colab notebooks in order to learn how neural nets, datasets, training, configuration and inference runs through a hands on approach. Even if brief, it showcased perfectly how these concepts work on a fundamental basis and invites students to reach new depths.

I also explored with different Image generating AI tools to feed inspiration and ideas to my project.
