What if we could reimagine the interactions we have with our autonomous nervous system, or our microbiome? In order to transform a system of individuality, the individual must first be transformed. At the current moment, my perspective on regenerative design focuses on this direction. I believe that all other actions will just become admirable patches to provoke thought and make great things happen. Still, as long as the system runs its course and humanity egoistically continues to mistake richness for fools gold, we are doomed for failure. We must transform our entire perspective to save the planet and its billions of natural systems. Design, creation\u2026 it\u2019s all worth anything if it makes you happy. This wicked attempt makes me happy. On a more specific note, I\u2019ve been curious about the Autonomous Nervous System, the Polyvagal Theory and the concept that perceived stimuli affects our bodies and physical health in a surprisingly explicit way. The vast network of nerves that innervate various organs and systems throughout the body are expressing, communicating and living. They can say when they are tense, fearful or anxious or express safety, relaxation and happiness. What if we listened? I\u2019ve also been thinking about the role of design for medical devices. I am sure that the futures of this field are exciting and portray revolutionary characteristics, yet, there are important aspects that are important to consider across this evolution and that I would like to explore. There are health \u201cstandards\u201d that are unattainable since birth for some. A more holistic approach to health that moves towards what feels good from a nervous perspective could allow humans to make better choices for their health. Also, what are some ways in which devices can remove the impact of electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) for people that need to live with technology embedded for health purposes (i.e insulin pump, or CGM). All that said, I\u2019ve decided to begin a journey to design a biofeedback sensing device that measures and tracks physiological indicators associated with the different states of the nervous system. For purpose of simplicity, I will refer to this concept to BioSensing this point forward. I am aware that this is a complex task that requires vast resources and conditions that I do not posses, but I am ventured to create a raw prototype as a means to research through design. I would also like to open a door towards research, attention and action in the space of holistic approaches to health and wellbeing and to provide open sourced tools for humans to decide for healing, mindfulness, and collectivism. Biofeedback: a technique to provide an individual with information about their bodily functions in order to help them regulate and improve their physiological responses. \u201cA form of mind over matter. A technique to control pain and anxiety. (Philip Herbert, Biofeedback Book of Secrets) There are several types of biofeedback, including Electromyography (EMG) biofeedback, Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback, Respiration biofeedback, Skin conductance biofeedback, and Temperature biofeedback, each of which measures different aspects of the body\u2019s physiology. The defined technique essentially consists of understanding physiological insights and learning how to control them. Although the end objective of BioSensing is not to control pain or anxiety, it can extract some of the best features from biofeedback to promote healing and wellness. The idea of the device is to collect real-time feedback on the activity of the nervous system to allow humans to understand how their body is responding to different activities, people, foods or environments, and make more informed decisions about how to care for themselves. By tracking and understanding the activity of the nervous system, we can learn to identify patterns and triggers that lead to stress, tension, or other negative responses, and take steps to address them. For example, if we notice that skin conductance increases when we\u2019re in a certain room or spending time with a certain person, we could make changes to their environment or relationships to improve our overall well-being. It could also help us understand how different types of settings, dynamics or environments affect our nervous system. For example, we may discover that working outdoors makes us feel safer and more relaxed, while working in a confined space could increase our alertness. In terms of food, nutrition and exercise, this device could help us understand how different types of diet regimens and activities affect our nervous system and wellbeing. We can then use this information to make more informed decisions about what we eat, what types of physical activities we engage in, and how we spend our time. This is also a new way to approach health interpretation without idealizing perfect standards that are unattainable for some, and following what feels good for. In a world where this technology becomes accurate and can be a good predictor of nervous states or the ANS \u201cmood\u201d, with enough research, it could perhaps achieve a reliable comparison with a CGM and provide diabetes patients a more holistic approach to living with the need to sustain excellent wellbeing across daily life. Another important aspect of this device is its ability to provide a new open-source perspective for research on the nervous system. Researchers in fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and medicine can use the data collected by these devices to gain a deeper understanding of how the nervous system functions and how it responds to different stimuli. It could even become a great tool for educators and for people to learn about the nervous system, mental health and regenerative behavior. BioSensing showcases potential for a powerful tool for individuals to co-create well-being with our non-human life by providing us with a direct line of communication to our own nervous system, helping us understand how to better care for ourselves. It also contemplates what it means to design for regenerative futures since it empowers individuals to take a proactive and preventative approach to our own health and well-being.","title":"Master Project"},{"location":"MasterProject/01-SeedsandConcepts/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"MasterProject/01-SeedsandConcepts/#seeds-and-concepts","text":"1 ~ Health + Wellness Monitoring 2 ~ Regenerative Education 3 ~ Redefining Convenience","title":"Seeds and concepts"},{"location":"MasterProject/01-SeedsandConcepts/#biosensing","text":"What if we could communicate with our inner worlds, natural systems and environments?

It\u2019s in the beginning where identity, purpose and vision are aligned and pushed forwards. This journey of introspection and ideation requires courage and creativity. The AoWS deck was a useful instrument to put into words concepts that are often complex and hard to express. When encountering a word I did not know, the images on the cards opened a space for imagination and interpretation. Moreover, it was surprisingly interesting how easy it was to use the cards to have deep conversations about topics that move something inside us.

Here, I am particularly interested in Diabetes and Renal Failure as well as understanding habits and thinking patterns inside the health spectrum. That is, what makes people action on their health? How can we re-imagine the relationship with our bodies in a more natural approach to health? The other side of the physical aspect is along the lines of Mental, Emotional and Energetic health. This involves understanding suffering, articulating it and working on liberation. A particular aspect I am interested inside this realm is that of ancestral conditioning and generational healing.

Role 1 - Experimental Component Test of specific hypothesis. Systematic variatons of prototype or context of use. Communication channels: Working to provide offgrid communities with a prepaid solar energy service required efficient communication. An explanation of the service was required, given that the technology was something new to this population and many questions needed to be answered. More importantly, we were required to provide efficient mass communications to reach numerous individuals simultaneously so as to comply with our expansion efforts. During this process, we were interested in learning which are the most effective channels that we could rely on for our communications. After initial research, we came up with four different proposals: Traditional posters and flyers at the point of sale. Participating in monthly COCODE (Mayor) meetings. Using the community PSA speakers. Sending flyers through kids at school. In this case, we outlined systematic variations of means of communication and measured which ones had a higher impact on communities energy use. We came to understand that people respected community authorities and that participating at the monthly meetings were most efficient because it generated word of mouth and a converstaion to move people to our points of sale. Still, complementary communication tools were required to fulfill all expectations. Role 2 - Means of Inquiry Open-ended exploration. Instrument to collect, record and measure phenomena. A new business model: The company I worked in engaged with a business model that provided customers with free maintenance and repairs for the prepaid solar systems. However, as the user base grew and our coverage expanded, the units began to surpass their life expectancy and a large number of batteries were failing. This really pushed any limits in terms of maintenance capacity, and our service levels dropped causing a steep incline in customer inactivity. That is, people were not using their prepaid units because they were not working properly due to battery issues. We were faced with a critical question: How can we provide maintenance to solar systems with a higher frequency while mantaining low operational costs? We designed a number of concepts based on field insights, and decided to test an MVP through a pilot/prototype. The new business model involved empowering shopkeepers with tools, knowledge, skills and incentives so that community users could receive a maintenance service at their shops. We then structured new community-based routes, instead of home-based routes. That would accelerate the time to respond upon the failure of a system, while simultaneously reducing operation costs, ultimately increasing user activity and rentability. In this particular scenario, we prototyped a new business model which involved the design of new processes, documentation, materials, scripts, vehicles, routes, training, software development, hardware development and all of the million details that are ingrained inside a business model. Through this project, set up a scenario where we not only tested this busines model prototype, but also dived deeply into the community which enabeled great learning about a great variety of phenomena. More importantly, we created a scenario to collect, record, observe and measure phenomena. Are users willing to go to the shops for maintenace repairs? Is user activity increasing through higher frequency repairs? How loyal are users to the brand? What is the size of the value being generated for users? What impact does the product have on the community? How is the brand empowering individuals in rural communities? Role 3 - Research Archetype Illustration or demonstration. Physical embodiment of research concept, understanding or design reseach space Diving into the deep: In order to understand better how to improve our product offering, we understood that simply talking to users was not enough. Even ethnographic observation had its limits and could not provide answers to critical questions. With this context in mind, I designed an experiment to understand how our users actually lived and through this, how our product interacted inside their lives. I packed my bags and travelled off the grid into a carefully selected community in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. There, I rented a small wooden shack from a shopkeeper where I stayed for three weeks to embody the purest user experience.

Role 1 - Experimental Component Test of specific hypothesis. Systematic variatons of prototype or context of use. Communication channels: Working to provide offgrid communities with a prepaid solar energy service required efficient communication. An explanation of the service was required, given that the technology was something new to this population and many questions needed to be answered. More importantly, we were required to provide efficient mass communications to reach numerous individuals simultaneously so as to comply with our expansion efforts. During this process, we were interested in learning which are the most effective channels that we could rely on for our communications. After initial research, we came up with four different proposals: Traditional posters and flyers at the point of sale. Participating in monthly COCODE (Mayor) meetings. Using the community PSA speakers. Sending flyers through kids at school. In this case, we outlined systematic variations of means of communication and measured which ones had a higher impact on communities energy use. We came to understand that people respected community authorities and that participating at the monthly meetings were most efficient because it generated word of mouth and a converstaion to move people to our points of sale. Still, complementary communication tools were required to fulfill all expectations. Role 2 - Means of Inquiry Open-ended exploration. Instrument to collect, record and measure phenomena. A new business model: The company I worked in engaged with a business model that provided customers with free maintenance and repairs for the prepaid solar systems. However, as the user base grew and our coverage expanded, the units began to surpass their life expectancy and a large number of batteries were failing. This really pushed any limits in terms of maintenance capacity, and our service levels dropped causing a steep incline in customer inactivity. That is, people were not using their prepaid units because they were not working properly due to battery issues. We were faced with a critical question: How can we provide maintenance to solar systems with a higher frequency while mantaining low operational costs? We designed a number of concepts based on field insights, and decided to test an MVP through a pilot/prototype. The new business model involved empowering shopkeepers with tools, knowledge, skills and incentives so that community users could receive a maintenance service at their shops. We then structured new community-based routes, instead of home-based routes. That would accelerate the time to respond upon the failure of a system, while simultaneously reducing operation costs, ultimately increasing user activity and rentability. In this particular scenario, we prototyped a new business model which involved the design of new processes, documentation, materials, scripts, vehicles, routes, training, software development, hardware development and all of the million details that are ingrained inside a business model. Through this project, set up a scenario where we not only tested this busines model prototype, but also dived deeply into the community which enabeled great learning about a great variety of phenomena. More importantly, we created a scenario to collect, record, observe and measure phenomena. Are users willing to go to the shops for maintenace repairs? Is user activity increasing through higher frequency repairs? How loyal are users to the brand? What is the size of the value being generated for users? What impact does the product have on the community? How is the brand empowering individuals in rural communities? Role 3 - Research Archetype Illustration or demonstration. Physical embodiment of research concept, understanding or design reseach space Diving into the deep: In order to understand better how to improve our product offering, we understood that simply talking to users was not enough. Even ethnographic observation had its limits and could not provide answers to critical questions. With this context in mind, I designed an experiment to understand how our users actually lived and through this, how our product interacted inside their lives. I packed my bags and travelled off the grid into a carefully selected community in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. There, I rented a small wooden shack from a shopkeeper where I stayed for three weeks to embody the purest user experience. I used the solar system every day, and lived through the same pain points that our users faced every day and night. Not only in technical specifications but also in feelings, routines, habits, relationships, dynamics and insights that can only be experienced. Both product and service aspects were refined following the insights from this research activity and user activity was improved. Role 4 - Vehicle for Inquiry Driver for the research director.

Why did it matter? Functional health considers diet and exercise as the keys to disease prevention and a life full of energy and possibilities. Yet, strict diet regimens and timed exercise are hard to follow and often require much greater than following a prescription. Even as a healthy person, I wanted to understand what it would feel like to be forced to highly structured healthy lifestyle. Moreover, I wanted to know what would happen if I attempt to understand my health by measuring it. So, I decided to understand what the day in the life looks like for a type 2 diabetic. Diabetes affects the body by affecting the production and the resistance of insulin, which plays a vital role in health and wellbeing. Mainly, this hormone allows glucose (sugar in the blood ) to enter our fat, muscles and liver allowing us to produce and store energy. When our insulin becomes affected we need to help the body regulate the levels of sugar in the blood and we can do this through a balanced diet and exercise. When this combination is not enough, sometimes it can be necessary to aid our body with additional insulin so that we can continue to live functional and happy lives. High blood pressure can often come hand in hand with diabetes, and is something to monitor regardless of health status.

Instant glucose measurement Blood pressure measurement Perceiving and decoding stimuli Feelings or sensations Emotions Triggers Habits Thoughts It was an incredible experience, which I came to appreciate and enjoy with gratitude and awareness. I honestly believe that more awareness on health and chronic diseas is needed, and that more people should be aware of the different needs of diabetic patients. Living with a strict diet can be demanding and difficult, especially when living inside such a toxic system that\u2019s nurtured by sugar, highly processed foods, harmful fats and chemicals; a system that is not natural. During this experience, most of the shops or restaurants that I normally interacted with were not accessible and I had to seek alternatives (often spending or walking more). The same happened at a social level when I decided not to join some friends for a drink, or for anything at all. I find it critical to redesign our systems to become more natural and healthy for humans and the planet. To enjoy leisure, food and drink, work, or day to day living in a regenerative style that improves our wellbeing. Society ought to be more careful to not disregard the danger of normalizing a toxic system that harms our bodies and minds.

I find the concept of CGMs and Insulin Pumps fascinating, as they automate tasks and make life easier. Although I could not gain value from my prototyped CGM, having something attached to my body for more than 24 hours was really an experience. It is uncomfortable. It itches and sometimes really hurts. Taking it off was really painful as well, and some of the sealing glue remained unremovable. Although this was just a prototype, I can imagine what it means to live with technology embedded and insist that there is tremendous opportunity to improve wellbeing and help patients to live more comfortable with technology. This last remark also plays with the concept of a spectrum between peace and anxiety when measuring to understand. Sometimes, measuring can become an act of relief but other times it can become an act of control. During the exercise, I came to experience the fear of truly accepting an unwanted measurement. It\u2019s a rollercoaster of emotions and can surely affect anxiety levels. All in all, I found a direct relationship between physical health, mental health and the context we live in. The things we eat, the places we go, the habits we live with and how we react to our environment shapes our wellbeing.

Not knowing if I may be indicating a health problem gives me fear and anxiety, but once I understand that I am healthy then I can enjoy life even more peaceful.

How can we position ourselves as designers and design in the midst of such complex problems? Mapping \u00b6 In order to approach complex problems with a holistic perspective and to position ourselves effectively in the midst of these issues, it is important to consider all stakeholders and influences that affect the problem in focus. One effective tool for this is mapping, which allows us to visually organize and understand the different components and relationships within a problem. By mapping out the various influences, stimulus and factors involved, we can gain a better understanding of the problem and identify potential areas for intervention. Mapping also becomes a valuable tool for collective sense-making, as it allows for open and inclusive participation from all stakeholders. By inviting diverse perspectives and voices to contribute to the map, we can create a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions. Mapping can also help to identify patterns, trends and opportunities that can inform the design process, this would be a great way to explore the possible solutions and to come up with new ideas and concepts. I enjoyed exploring this tool during the class and have already implemented into my work and studies. Creative Community Engagement \u00b6 Creative Community: A diverse group of individuals that includes chefs, food bloggers, farmers, nutritionists and health advocates in Poble Nou district, in Barecelona. They are united by their passion for food and their desire to promote health through nutrition, reflection and education. Context: The community is located in the Poble Nou district, in Barecelona. An emerging neighborhood that is currently experiencing rapid movement and asynchronous evolution. Barcelona is rich in culinary heritage and enjoys a vibrant food scene. However, like many urban areas, unhealthy food options are easily accessible and heavily marketed, leading to high rates diet-related illnesses. The community aims to address these issues by promoting healthy, sustainable food options and educating the public on the importance of nutrition. Current Situation: Among the many problems being faced by the community at the moment, the largest problem in hand is that of harmful convenience. Fast food and processed food are readily available and often cheaper than healthier options, making it difficult for individuals to make healthy choices. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the food industry, leading to closures and job losses, making it harder for people to access healthy food choices. Engagement & Limits: The community thrives on collectivism and shared values, with regular events and meetings to share ideas and collaborate on projects. They also engage with the public through social media and public events, such as community gardens mornings, farmers\u2019 markets and cooking classes. However, the community is limited by financial constraints and a lack of resources, which can make it difficult to implement some of their more ambitious ideas and reach a wider population. Theory of Change: The community\u2019s theory of change is to use their collective creativity and passion for food to promote healthy food choices and lifestyles. They aim to achieve this by providing education on the importance of nutrition, organizing events to promote healthy food options, and collaborating with other organizations to create sustainable food systems that make healthy choices more accessible and affordable.

One effective tool for this is mapping, which allows us to visually organize and understand the different components and relationships within a problem. By mapping out the various influences, stimulus and factors involved, we can gain a better understanding of the problem and identify potential areas for intervention. Mapping also becomes a valuable tool for collective sense-making, as it allows for open and inclusive participation from all stakeholders. By inviting diverse perspectives and voices to contribute to the map, we can create a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions. Mapping can also help to identify patterns, trends and opportunities that can inform the design process, this would be a great way to explore the possible solutions and to come up with new ideas and concepts. I enjoyed exploring this tool during the class and have already implemented into my work and studies.","title":"Mapping"},{"location":"term1/06-CommunityEngagement/#creative-community-engagement","text":"Creative Community: A diverse group of individuals that includes chefs, food bloggers, farmers, nutritionists and health advocates in Poble Nou district, in Barecelona. They are united by their passion for food and their desire to promote health through nutrition, reflection and education. Context: The community is located in the Poble Nou district, in Barecelona. An emerging neighborhood that is currently experiencing rapid movement and asynchronous evolution. Barcelona is rich in culinary heritage and enjoys a vibrant food scene. However, like many urban areas, unhealthy food options are easily accessible and heavily marketed, leading to high rates diet-related illnesses. The community aims to address these issues by promoting healthy, sustainable food options and educating the public on the importance of nutrition. Current Situation: Among the many problems being faced by the community at the moment, the largest problem in hand is that of harmful convenience. Fast food and processed food are readily available and often cheaper than healthier options, making it difficult for individuals to make healthy choices. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the food industry, leading to closures and job losses, making it harder for people to access healthy food choices. Engagement & Limits: The community thrives on collectivism and shared values, with regular events and meetings to share ideas and collaborate on projects. They also engage with the public through social media and public events, such as community gardens mornings, farmers\u2019 markets and cooking classes. However, the community is limited by financial constraints and a lack of resources, which can make it difficult to implement some of their more ambitious ideas and reach a wider population. Theory of Change: The community\u2019s theory of change is to use their collective creativity and passion for food to promote healthy food choices and lifestyles. They aim to achieve this by providing education on the importance of nutrition, organizing events to promote healthy food options, and collaborating with other organizations to create sustainable food systems that make healthy choices more accessible and affordable. Design challenges: The need to create more sustainable food systems and the need to promote healthy food choices in an environment that heavily markets unhealthy options. Opportunities: Innovation and creativity, such as developing new recipes, creating new food-based businesses that promote healthy options, and experimenting with new technologies to improve food production in a sustainable way.","title":"Creative Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-ExtendedIntelligences/","text":"\u00b6 Extended Intelligences \u00b6 This brief course on AI and Extended Intelligences was really exciting and insightful.

This new definition is influenced by the dangers of normalizing toxicity and a system designed to harm and to destroy. From the things we ingest, to the relationships we have with ourselves, others and the planet. The ways in which we invest and spend time. The limits that are pushed by the necessity to produce and make money to sustain any lifestyle. I\u2019ve really come to question and rethink so many ideas through conversations, lessons and practice. Normality in today\u2019s era: - Supermarkets filled with toxic products rich in chemicals, additives, sugars and other highly processed ingredients. - Fast food high in unhealthy fats and carbohydrates. - Toxic and unhealthy convenience. - Alcohol and drug filled entertainment. - Producing for profit and not for a better world. - Promoting emptiness and superficiality, seeking fools gold. - Lack of awareness of damage to planet or living species. - Ego driven society. - Corrupt politics. Perhaps the reason why reality is as is, and what could lie ahead is alarming and frightening, is that we are damaged as a human collective. Society has inherited, and continues to evolve great trauma. Although mental health issues and psychology have always drawn my interest, it was not until this term that I really understood the relevance it has on modern development.

Awareness, presence, gratitude, healing of trauma and making therapy accessible for all are proven concepts to increase wellbeing. If the human collective is healthier in this sense, then we could assume to see an increase in behavior that is good for people, living species and for the planet as a whole. Mindfulness, a connection with nature, and a sense of safety are also critical and relevant. Yet, not all determinants of this behavior are related to mental health or spirituality. Some are dictated by the system we live in, and by the thigs we have come to normalize (as described before). Others are dictated by privilege and luck, like having the time to meditate, or the money to purchase healthy food, or even the education we receive or the experiences we live through since birth. Although this definition may be broad or vague, it is a starting point to define the type of behavior that I believe will be critical to create a healthy future. One where humanity ingests real food and convenience has been redefined to foster health of both humanity, other living species and of the planet. A future filled with opportunities to produce in a sustainable and regenerative fashion, where trauma has been healed and decisions are based on love, awareness and gratitude. One where humanity feels safe and rewires its nervous system to sustain social engagement, calmness, curiosity, openness, compassion and presence. If we are well, then we can create wellness and develop with a system that regenerates, heals, improves and enables.

I\u2019ve opened a door into a part of living with purpose that is new, exciting, confusing, and fun experience. From the design perspective, I am learning to navigate a new approach to seeing, creating, and participating in the world. I\u2019ve also allowed myself to give shape to what is important to me, and the different directions that can give meaning to my everyday living. I\u2019ve become educated in concepts that I perhaps should have been already more aware of. I\u2019ve also connected with great designers and references that demonstrate an original and futuristic way to provoke thought and emotion. It certainly took some time to adapt to the change of hats and owning the \u2018designer persona\u2019 and the new framework to research, create and propose. Still, through intervention explorations I can now articulate that I am interested in exploring Regeneration . Regeneration means designing not only to minimize negative impacts, but to actively restore and improve the systems depended on. It is a holistic approach that goes beyond reducing harm by focusing on creating positive impact and regenerating. Regeneration is about creating positive impact on the environment and promoting revitalization of natural systems. Yet, from a multi-scalar perspective, this definition can be also refer to natural systems or environments within us such as our nervous system or our microbiome. These natural systems play a fundamental role in evolution if a desired future of health, mindfulness and collectivism is possible. That is why I am focusing my projects and energy towards regenerative futures. I intend to explore ways in which we can heal and enjoy true wellness. To enjoy honest and revitalizing relationships with ourselves, with our community, with other non-human life, with all life. Perhaps it is not possible to change the world, but I am sure that great things can happen if we are emotionally free and act by love. These are some ideas that I am exploring and developing: Nervous System Biosensor: \u00b6 A device that uses available biofeedback technologies including HRV, respiration, skin conductance, EMG, and temperature to monitor and evaluate the different states of the nervous system. This device could be used for research purposes to indicate whether certain designs have a better nervous response than others. It could also be used for other research purposes that could provide insights in designing for safer spaces, relationships, dynamics, food systems and a wide range of stimuli. Education on Mind Matters (regenerative ed.): \u00b6 Transforming the individual could dissolve individualism and an ego driven evolution. Education plays a key role in this development and goes beyond the seeds planted at school or at home. We are constantly decoding different stimuli. I would like to create stimulations through art, through content, through video, through experiences. Provoke thought and reflection and provide a renewed vision of reality. I would also like to synthesize complex workshops on healing and design healthy and insightful ways to normalize regenerative practices and collectivism. New project goals: \u00b6 Begin exploring with a design for the Nervous System biosensor. Design an experiment with mycelium in two (or more) distinct environments. Document the evolution of the natural systems when exposed to positive and negative stimuli. Design a workshop that synthesizes Zubieta\u2019s Flowing Inside-Out 5 day workshop into an easy to digest 4 hour collective session. Design a collective brainstorming session with different people interested in food and health to re-imagine and to co-create healthy convenience for the futures. Explore with a communal education model that uses vertical gardens, neighborhood gardens or even plants or mushrooms as key resources. Explore and have conversations around industrializing biomaterials and waste collecting systems. Explore devices to measure and understand the microbiome, and seek for ways to DIY pre/probiotics or access biome regulating and regenerating technology.","title":"Inputs / Outputs"},{"location":"term2/00-DesignJourney/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"term2/00-DesignJourney/#mdef-term-i-journey","text":"Constant change and reconfiguration are aspects of regeneration , and this has also been true for the last months and first term at MDEF.
