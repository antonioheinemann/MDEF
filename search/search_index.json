The way MDEf allows students to participate inside this wide ecosystem and inspire us make our ideas a reality is empowering. I am beginning to grasp the power of being a designer and the impact I can have for a healthier, more sustainable and conscious future. My vision: \u00b6 I dream that everyone, disregarding economic status, can enjoy basic health and education services. I dream of a world where health is safe, reliable, and convenient for all disregarding location or economic status. I dream that the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) has the tools, knowledge and capabilities to sustainabily co-create a new future filled with opportunities and dreams made true. I dream that future generations are educated in how to eat, exercise and live a healthy life. I dream that future generations will live by sustainable practices, honor and respect the planet and all inside it. I dream of an integrated digital global community. I dream that the youth in the BoP will change the world by becoming a powerhouse of value generation.

It\u2019s in the beginning where identity, purpose and vision are aligned and pushed forwards. This journey of introspection and ideation requires courage and creativity. The AoWS deck was a useful instrument to put into words concepts that are often complex and hard to express. When encountering a word I did not know, the images on the cards opened a space for imagination and interpretation. Moreover, it was surprisingly interesting how easy it was to use the cards to have deep conversations about topics that move something inside us. Creating a design space after this synthesized the entire knowledge acquired across the week; it was a surreal life exercise. I was deeply moved by Mariana, her kindness and joyful excitement about MDEF. For reasons I can\u2019t fully comprehend I was touched by hearing her personal story. Perhaps I connected personally with some of the feelings that she or others may have had to interact with in life. All I say is that I am grateful to be in this moment in life and learn from amazing human beings. I am grateful to be in this journey of self-exploration, creation and evolution. Narrowing down was a difficult task as I had many interests to explore. Yet, I managed to map three design areas: Health Natural and Sustainable Empowering Creation Design Space \u00b6 HEALTH \u00b6 Physical Emotional Mental Energetic I am interested in understanding those aspects that are most relevant in the health, specifically of humans. I am also interested in the health of all living beings, and of the planet, and so this topic could get much broader with time but for now my interests are purely human and anatomical. That is, how humans are interacting to topics such as disease, prevention, access, financing. Here, I am particularly interested in Diabetes and Renal Failure as well as understanding habits and thinking patterns inside the health spectrum. That is, what makes people action on their health? How can we re-imagine the relationship with our bodies in a more natural approach to health? The other side of the physical aspect is along the lines of Mental, Emotional and Energetic health. This involves understanding suffering, articulating it and working on liberation. A particular aspect I am interested inside this realm is that of ancestral conditioning and generational healing. Also, I am interested by understanding how neurological wiring frames our being and the importance of understanding this. All sort of ideas spark into mind with Health. Health Literacy Medical Devices Measuring as a means of understanding Functional Medicine Prevention before reaction Regenerative Health Food as Medicine Holistic Therapy Healing and Liberation NATURAL AND SUSTAINABLE \u00b6 Recycling and reutilization Reforestation Ingesting real and natural Regenerative design In this side of the design space, I draw inspiration from mother nature. Going back to the roots, to our ancestral origins of connecting with what is real and what provides sustainability for the future. Having been in close contact with nature throughout my life, a thing that truly saddens me is witnessing the destruction of sacred nature. Rivers, mountains, forests, species\u2026 All is destroyed in aims to survive and participate in this twisted world we live in. One aspect I take to heart is reforestation, having a strong passion to grow trees, funghi and ecosystems to give back to mother nature and improve the world through cleaner air. Also, given the importance of reusing plastics, I am also generating ideas of how to build on distributed design principles and plastic recycling to solve important problems. From building blocks, to other construction pieces, or really any sort of items, this concept is something that has great potential in rural futures. Finally, I am also interested in understanding the idea of ingesting real and natural. This means that what I am putting into my body is something that my body actually can process and contributes to better health. This also means that I am respecting mother nature in this process. EMPOWERING CREATION \u00b6 Open source innovation Design for impact Scalar Thinking Maker mindset Distributed design This is probably the vaguest side of the design space, since there are not a lot of ideas but a lot of feelings and aspired potential. At an intuitive level, I understand that creating is my passion and that I want to empower others to create as well. Hopefully, together and aligned towards making the world healthier, more sustainable and more creative. These words trigger something in me. They move me and inspire me to imagine ways of co-creating new futures. Of building amazing collective stories to inspire others to join on changing the world. Having such a strong passion for creating, I am interested in learning so much about making, ideation, design, and open-source innovation. More importantly, this co-creation aspect has to be linked across different scales and dimensions. My mind is always on the rural futures and the potential to collectively transform them.","title":"02 AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-AoWS/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"This week has been one of the most profound moments until now.

Role 1 - Experimental Component Test of specific hypothesis. Systematic variatons of prototype or context of use. Communication channels: Working to provide offgrid communities with a prepaid solar energy service required efficient communication. An explanation of the service was required, given that the technology was something new to this population and many questions needed to be answered. More importantly, we were required to provide efficient mass communications to reach numerous individuals simultaneously so as to comply with our expansion efforts. During this process, we were interested in learning which are the most effective channels that we could rely on for our communications. After initial research, we came up with four different proposals: Traditional posters and flyers at the point of sale. Participating in monthly COCODE (Mayor) meetings. Using the community PSA speakers. Sending flyers through kids at school. In this case, we outlined systematic variations of means of communication and measured which ones had a higher impact on communities energy use. We came to understand that people respected community authorities and that participating at the monthly meetings were most efficient because it generated word of mouth and a converstaion to move people to our points of sale. Still, complementary communication tools were required to fulfill all expectations. Role 2 - Means of Inquiry Open-ended exploration. Instrument to collect, record and measure phenomena. A new business model: The company I worked in engaged with a business model that provided customers with free maintenance and repairs for the prepaid solar systems. However, as the user base grew and our coverage expanded, the units began to surpass their life expectancy and a large number of batteries were failing. This really pushed any limits in terms of maintenance capacity, and our service levels dropped causing a steep incline in customer inactivity. That is, people were not using their prepaid units because they were not working properly due to battery issues. We were faced with a critical question: How can we provide maintenance to solar systems with a higher frequency while mantaining low operational costs? We designed a number of concepts based on field insights, and decided to test an MVP through a pilot/prototype. The new business model involved empowering shopkeepers with tools, knowledge, skills and incentives so that community users could receive a maintenance service at their shops. We then structured new community-based routes, instead of home-based routes. That would accelerate the time to respond upon the failure of a system, while simultaneously reducing operation costs, ultimately increasing user activity and rentability. In this particular scenario, we prototyped a new business model which involved the design of new processes, documentation, materials, scripts, vehicles, routes, training, software development, hardware development and all of the million details that are ingrained inside a business model. Through this project, set up a scenario where we not only tested this busines model prototype, but also dived deeply into the community which enabeled great learning about a great variety of phenomena. More importantly, we created a scenario to collect, record, observe and measure phenomena. Are users willing to go to the shops for maintenace repairs? Is user activity increasing through higher frequency repairs? How loyal are users to the brand? What is the size of the value being generated for users? What impact does the product have on the community? How is the brand empowering individuals in rural communities? Role 3 - Research Archetype Illustration or demonstration. Physical embodiment of research concept, understanding or design reseach space Diving into the deep: In order to understand better how to improve our product offering, we understood that simply talking to users was not enough. Even ethnographic observation had its limits and could not provide answers to critical questions. With this context in mind, I designed an experiment to understand how our users actually lived and through this, how our product interacted inside their lives. I packed my bags and travelled off the grid into a carefully selected community in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. There, I rented a small wooden shack from a shopkeeper where I stayed for three weeks to embody the purest user experience. I used the solar system every day, and lived through the same pain points that our users faced every day and night. Not only in technical specifications but also in feelings, routines, habits, relationships, dynamics and insights that can only be experienced. Both product and service aspects were refined following the insights from this research activity and user activity was improved. Role 4 - Vehicle for Inquiry Driver for the research director. Research contribution is tied to the process of crafting the artifacts. Although I have collaborated in the design and crafting of different products or services, I have never really approached this excerecise as a focused artefact for learning. This sparks different ideas to mind, however since I am interested in understanding how people interact with their own health I am conceptualizing a prototyping activity where a small group of individuals are observed while collectively creating a device for health improvement. By witnessing the process of prototyping, documenting it, analyzing it and learning from the process itself I could understand important and interesting aspects of how people interact with their health.","title":"02 Prototyping"},{"location":"term1/02-Prototyping/#prototyping","text":"The diferent roles of prototyping, and examples of how I have used them in the past or how I intend to use them in the future.
