What if we could reimagine the interactions we have with our autonomous nervous system, or our microbiome? In order to transform a system of individuality, the individual must first be transformed. At the current moment, my perspective on regenerative design focuses on this direction. I believe that all other actions will just become admirable patches to provoke thought and make great things happen. Still, as long as the system runs its course and humanity egoistically continues to mistake richness for fools gold, we are doomed for failure. We must transform our entire perspective to save the planet and its billions of natural systems. Design, creation\u2026 it\u2019s all worth anything if it makes you happy. This wicked attempt makes me happy. On a more specific note, I\u2019ve been curious about the Autonomous Nervous System, the Polyvagal Theory and the concept that perceived stimuli affects our bodies and physical health in a surprisingly explicit way. The vast network of nerves that innervate various organs and systems throughout the body are expressing, communicating and living. They can say when they are tense, fearful or anxious or express safety, relaxation and happiness. What if we listened? I\u2019ve also been thinking about the role of design for medical devices. I am sure that the futures of this field are exciting and portray revolutionary characteristics, yet, there are important aspects that are important to consider across this evolution and that I would like to explore. There are health \u201cstandards\u201d that are unattainable since birth for some. A more holistic approach to health that moves towards what feels good from a nervous perspective could allow humans to make better choices for their health. Also, what are some ways in which devices can remove the impact of electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) for people that need to live with technology embedded for health purposes (i.e insulin pump, or CGM). All that said, I\u2019ve decided to begin a journey to design a biofeedback sensing device that measures and tracks physiological indicators associated with the different states of the nervous system. For purpose of simplicity, I will refer to this concept to BioSensing this point forward. I am aware that this is a complex task that requires vast resources and conditions that I do not posses, but I am ventured to create a raw prototype as a means to research through design. I would also like to open a door towards research, attention and action in the space of holistic approaches to health and wellbeing and to provide open sourced tools for humans to decide for healing, mindfulness, and collectivism. Biofeedback: a technique to provide an individual with information about their bodily functions in order to help them regulate and improve their physiological responses. \u201cA form of mind over matter. A technique to control pain and anxiety. (Philip Herbert, Biofeedback Book of Secrets) There are several types of biofeedback, including Electromyography (EMG) biofeedback, Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback, Respiration biofeedback, Skin conductance biofeedback, and Temperature biofeedback, each of which measures different aspects of the body\u2019s physiology. The defined technique essentially consists of understanding physiological insights and learning how to control them. Although the end objective of BioSensing is not to control pain or anxiety, it can extract some of the best features from biofeedback to promote healing and wellness. The idea of the device is to collect real-time feedback on the activity of the nervous system to allow humans to understand how their body is responding to different activities, people, foods or environments, and make more informed decisions about how to care for themselves. By tracking and understanding the activity of the nervous system, we can learn to identify patterns and triggers that lead to stress, tension, or other negative responses, and take steps to address them. For example, if we notice that skin conductance increases when we\u2019re in a certain room or spending time with a certain person, we could make changes to their environment or relationships to improve our overall well-being. It could also help us understand how different types of settings, dynamics or environments affect our nervous system. For example, we may discover that working outdoors makes us feel safer and more relaxed, while working in a confined space could increase our alertness. In terms of food, nutrition and exercise, this device could help us understand how different types of diet regimens and activities affect our nervous system and wellbeing. We can then use this information to make more informed decisions about what we eat, what types of physical activities we engage in, and how we spend our time. This is also a new way to approach health interpretation without idealizing perfect standards that are unattainable for some, and following what feels good for. In a world where this technology becomes accurate and can be a good predictor of nervous states or the ANS \u201cmood\u201d, with enough research, it could perhaps achieve a reliable comparison with a CGM and provide diabetes patients a more holistic approach to living with the need to sustain excellent wellbeing across daily life. Another important aspect of this device is its ability to provide a new open-source perspective for research on the nervous system. Researchers in fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and medicine can use the data collected by these devices to gain a deeper understanding of how the nervous system functions and how it responds to different stimuli. It could even become a great tool for educators and for people to learn about the nervous system, mental health and regenerative behavior. BioSensing showcases potential for a powerful tool for individuals to co-create well-being with our non-human life by providing us with a direct line of communication to our own nervous system, helping us understand how to better care for ourselves. It also contemplates what it means to design for regenerative futures since it empowers individuals to take a proactive and preventative approach to our own health and well-being.","title":"Master Project"},{"location":"MasterProject/01-SeedsandConcepts/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"MasterProject/01-SeedsandConcepts/#seeds-and-concepts","text":"1 ~ Health + Wellness Monitoring 2 ~ Regenerative Education 3 ~ Redefining Convenience","title":"Seeds and concepts"},{"location":"MasterProject/01-SeedsandConcepts/#biosensing","text":"What if we could communicate with our inner worlds, natural systems and environments?

It\u2019s in the beginning where identity, purpose and vision are aligned and pushed forwards. This journey of introspection and ideation requires courage and creativity. The AoWS deck was a useful instrument to put into words concepts that are often complex and hard to express. When encountering a word I did not know, the images on the cards opened a space for imagination and interpretation. Moreover, it was surprisingly interesting how easy it was to use the cards to have deep conversations about topics that move something inside us.

Here, I am particularly interested in Diabetes and Renal Failure as well as understanding habits and thinking patterns inside the health spectrum. That is, what makes people action on their health? How can we re-imagine the relationship with our bodies in a more natural approach to health? The other side of the physical aspect is along the lines of Mental, Emotional and Energetic health. This involves understanding suffering, articulating it and working on liberation. A particular aspect I am interested inside this realm is that of ancestral conditioning and generational healing.

Role 1 - Experimental Component Test of specific hypothesis. Systematic variatons of prototype or context of use. Communication channels: Working to provide offgrid communities with a prepaid solar energy service required efficient communication. An explanation of the service was required, given that the technology was something new to this population and many questions needed to be answered. More importantly, we were required to provide efficient mass communications to reach numerous individuals simultaneously so as to comply with our expansion efforts. During this process, we were interested in learning which are the most effective channels that we could rely on for our communications. After initial research, we came up with four different proposals: Traditional posters and flyers at the point of sale. Participating in monthly COCODE (Mayor) meetings. Using the community PSA speakers. Sending flyers through kids at school. In this case, we outlined systematic variations of means of communication and measured which ones had a higher impact on communities energy use. We came to understand that people respected community authorities and that participating at the monthly meetings were most efficient because it generated word of mouth and a converstaion to move people to our points of sale. Still, complementary communication tools were required to fulfill all expectations. Role 2 - Means of Inquiry Open-ended exploration. Instrument to collect, record and measure phenomena. A new business model: The company I worked in engaged with a business model that provided customers with free maintenance and repairs for the prepaid solar systems. However, as the user base grew and our coverage expanded, the units began to surpass their life expectancy and a large number of batteries were failing. This really pushed any limits in terms of maintenance capacity, and our service levels dropped causing a steep incline in customer inactivity. That is, people were not using their prepaid units because they were not working properly due to battery issues. We were faced with a critical question: How can we provide maintenance to solar systems with a higher frequency while mantaining low operational costs? We designed a number of concepts based on field insights, and decided to test an MVP through a pilot/prototype. The new business model involved empowering shopkeepers with tools, knowledge, skills and incentives so that community users could receive a maintenance service at their shops. We then structured new community-based routes, instead of home-based routes. That would accelerate the time to respond upon the failure of a system, while simultaneously reducing operation costs, ultimately increasing user activity and rentability. In this particular scenario, we prototyped a new business model which involved the design of new processes, documentation, materials, scripts, vehicles, routes, training, software development, hardware development and all of the million details that are ingrained inside a business model. Through this project, set up a scenario where we not only tested this busines model prototype, but also dived deeply into the community which enabeled great learning about a great variety of phenomena. More importantly, we created a scenario to collect, record, observe and measure phenomena. Are users willing to go to the shops for maintenace repairs? Is user activity increasing through higher frequency repairs? How loyal are users to the brand? What is the size of the value being generated for users? What impact does the product have on the community? How is the brand empowering individuals in rural communities? Role 3 - Research Archetype Illustration or demonstration. Physical embodiment of research concept, understanding or design reseach space Diving into the deep: In order to understand better how to improve our product offering, we understood that simply talking to users was not enough. Even ethnographic observation had its limits and could not provide answers to critical questions. With this context in mind, I designed an experiment to understand how our users actually lived and through this, how our product interacted inside their lives. I packed my bags and travelled off the grid into a carefully selected community in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. There, I rented a small wooden shack from a shopkeeper where I stayed for three weeks to embody the purest user experience.

Role 1 - Experimental Component Test of specific hypothesis. Systematic variatons of prototype or context of use. Communication channels: Working to provide offgrid communities with a prepaid solar energy service required efficient communication. An explanation of the service was required, given that the technology was something new to this population and many questions needed to be answered. More importantly, we were required to provide efficient mass communications to reach numerous individuals simultaneously so as to comply with our expansion efforts. During this process, we were interested in learning which are the most effective channels that we could rely on for our communications. After initial research, we came up with four different proposals: Traditional posters and flyers at the point of sale. Participating in monthly COCODE (Mayor) meetings. Using the community PSA speakers. Sending flyers through kids at school. In this case, we outlined systematic variations of means of communication and measured which ones had a higher impact on communities energy use. We came to understand that people respected community authorities and that participating at the monthly meetings were most efficient because it generated word of mouth and a converstaion to move people to our points of sale. Still, complementary communication tools were required to fulfill all expectations. Role 2 - Means of Inquiry Open-ended exploration. Instrument to collect, record and measure phenomena. A new business model: The company I worked in engaged with a business model that provided customers with free maintenance and repairs for the prepaid solar systems. However, as the user base grew and our coverage expanded, the units began to surpass their life expectancy and a large number of batteries were failing. This really pushed any limits in terms of maintenance capacity, and our service levels dropped causing a steep incline in customer inactivity. That is, people were not using their prepaid units because they were not working properly due to battery issues. We were faced with a critical question: How can we provide maintenance to solar systems with a higher frequency while mantaining low operational costs? We designed a number of concepts based on field insights, and decided to test an MVP through a pilot/prototype. The new business model involved empowering shopkeepers with tools, knowledge, skills and incentives so that community users could receive a maintenance service at their shops. We then structured new community-based routes, instead of home-based routes. That would accelerate the time to respond upon the failure of a system, while simultaneously reducing operation costs, ultimately increasing user activity and rentability. In this particular scenario, we prototyped a new business model which involved the design of new processes, documentation, materials, scripts, vehicles, routes, training, software development, hardware development and all of the million details that are ingrained inside a business model. Through this project, set up a scenario where we not only tested this busines model prototype, but also dived deeply into the community which enabeled great learning about a great variety of phenomena. More importantly, we created a scenario to collect, record, observe and measure phenomena. Are users willing to go to the shops for maintenace repairs? Is user activity increasing through higher frequency repairs? How loyal are users to the brand? What is the size of the value being generated for users? What impact does the product have on the community? How is the brand empowering individuals in rural communities? Role 3 - Research Archetype Illustration or demonstration. Physical embodiment of research concept, understanding or design reseach space Diving into the deep: In order to understand better how to improve our product offering, we understood that simply talking to users was not enough. Even ethnographic observation had its limits and could not provide answers to critical questions. With this context in mind, I designed an experiment to understand how our users actually lived and through this, how our product interacted inside their lives. I packed my bags and travelled off the grid into a carefully selected community in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. There, I rented a small wooden shack from a shopkeeper where I stayed for three weeks to embody the purest user experience. I used the solar system every day, and lived through the same pain points that our users faced every day and night. Not only in technical specifications but also in feelings, routines, habits, relationships, dynamics and insights that can only be experienced. Both product and service aspects were refined following the insights from this research activity and user activity was improved. Role 4 - Vehicle for Inquiry Driver for the research director.

Why did it matter? Functional health considers diet and exercise as the keys to disease prevention and a life full of energy and possibilities. Yet, strict diet regimens and timed exercise are hard to follow and often require much greater than following a prescription. Even as a healthy person, I wanted to understand what it would feel like to be forced to highly structured healthy lifestyle. Moreover, I wanted to know what would happen if I attempt to understand my health by measuring it. So, I decided to understand what the day in the life looks like for a type 2 diabetic. Diabetes affects the body by affecting the production and the resistance of insulin, which plays a vital role in health and wellbeing. Mainly, this hormone allows glucose (sugar in the blood ) to enter our fat, muscles and liver allowing us to produce and store energy. When our insulin becomes affected we need to help the body regulate the levels of sugar in the blood and we can do this through a balanced diet and exercise. When this combination is not enough, sometimes it can be necessary to aid our body with additional insulin so that we can continue to live functional and happy lives. High blood pressure can often come hand in hand with diabetes, and is something to monitor regardless of health status.

Instant glucose measurement Blood pressure measurement Perceiving and decoding stimuli Feelings or sensations Emotions Triggers Habits Thoughts It was an incredible experience, which I came to appreciate and enjoy with gratitude and awareness. I honestly believe that more awareness on health and chronic diseas is needed, and that more people should be aware of the different needs of diabetic patients. Living with a strict diet can be demanding and difficult, especially when living inside such a toxic system that\u2019s nurtured by sugar, highly processed foods, harmful fats and chemicals; a system that is not natural. During this experience, most of the shops or restaurants that I normally interacted with were not accessible and I had to seek alternatives (often spending or walking more). The same happened at a social level when I decided not to join some friends for a drink, or for anything at all. I find it critical to redesign our systems to become more natural and healthy for humans and the planet. To enjoy leisure, food and drink, work, or day to day living in a regenerative style that improves our wellbeing. Society ought to be more careful to not disregard the danger of normalizing a toxic system that harms our bodies and minds.

I find the concept of CGMs and Insulin Pumps fascinating, as they automate tasks and make life easier. Although I could not gain value from my prototyped CGM, having something attached to my body for more than 24 hours was really an experience. It is uncomfortable. It itches and sometimes really hurts. Taking it off was really painful as well, and some of the sealing glue remained unremovable. Although this was just a prototype, I can imagine what it means to live with technology embedded and insist that there is tremendous opportunity to improve wellbeing and help patients to live more comfortable with technology. This last remark also plays with the concept of a spectrum between peace and anxiety when measuring to understand. Sometimes, measuring can become an act of relief but other times it can become an act of control. During the exercise, I came to experience the fear of truly accepting an unwanted measurement. It\u2019s a rollercoaster of emotions and can surely affect anxiety levels. All in all, I found a direct relationship between physical health, mental health and the context we live in. The things we eat, the places we go, the habits we live with and how we react to our environment shapes our wellbeing.

Not knowing if I may be indicating a health problem gives me fear and anxiety, but once I understand that I am healthy then I can enjoy life even more peaceful.

How can we position ourselves as designers and design in the midst of such complex problems? Mapping \u00b6 In order to approach complex problems with a holistic perspective and to position ourselves effectively in the midst of these issues, it is important to consider all stakeholders and influences that affect the problem in focus. One effective tool for this is mapping, which allows us to visually organize and understand the different components and relationships within a problem. By mapping out the various influences, stimulus and factors involved, we can gain a better understanding of the problem and identify potential areas for intervention. Mapping also becomes a valuable tool for collective sense-making, as it allows for open and inclusive participation from all stakeholders. By inviting diverse perspectives and voices to contribute to the map, we can create a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions. Mapping can also help to identify patterns, trends and opportunities that can inform the design process, this would be a great way to explore the possible solutions and to come up with new ideas and concepts. I enjoyed exploring this tool during the class and have already implemented into my work and studies. Creative Community Engagement \u00b6 Creative Community: A diverse group of individuals that includes chefs, food bloggers, farmers, nutritionists and health advocates in Poble Nou district, in Barecelona. They are united by their passion for food and their desire to promote health through nutrition, reflection and education. Context: The community is located in the Poble Nou district, in Barecelona. An emerging neighborhood that is currently experiencing rapid movement and asynchronous evolution. Barcelona is rich in culinary heritage and enjoys a vibrant food scene. However, like many urban areas, unhealthy food options are easily accessible and heavily marketed, leading to high rates diet-related illnesses. The community aims to address these issues by promoting healthy, sustainable food options and educating the public on the importance of nutrition. Current Situation: Among the many problems being faced by the community at the moment, the largest problem in hand is that of harmful convenience. Fast food and processed food are readily available and often cheaper than healthier options, making it difficult for individuals to make healthy choices. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the food industry, leading to closures and job losses, making it harder for people to access healthy food choices. Engagement & Limits: The community thrives on collectivism and shared values, with regular events and meetings to share ideas and collaborate on projects. They also engage with the public through social media and public events, such as community gardens mornings, farmers\u2019 markets and cooking classes. However, the community is limited by financial constraints and a lack of resources, which can make it difficult to implement some of their more ambitious ideas and reach a wider population. Theory of Change: The community\u2019s theory of change is to use their collective creativity and passion for food to promote healthy food choices and lifestyles. They aim to achieve this by providing education on the importance of nutrition, organizing events to promote healthy food options, and collaborating with other organizations to create sustainable food systems that make healthy choices more accessible and affordable.

One effective tool for this is mapping, which allows us to visually organize and understand the different components and relationships within a problem. By mapping out the various influences, stimulus and factors involved, we can gain a better understanding of the problem and identify potential areas for intervention. Mapping also becomes a valuable tool for collective sense-making, as it allows for open and inclusive participation from all stakeholders. By inviting diverse perspectives and voices to contribute to the map, we can create a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions. Mapping can also help to identify patterns, trends and opportunities that can inform the design process, this would be a great way to explore the possible solutions and to come up with new ideas and concepts. I enjoyed exploring this tool during the class and have already implemented into my work and studies.","title":"Mapping"},{"location":"term1/06-CommunityEngagement/#creative-community-engagement","text":"Creative Community: A diverse group of individuals that includes chefs, food bloggers, farmers, nutritionists and health advocates in Poble Nou district, in Barecelona. They are united by their passion for food and their desire to promote health through nutrition, reflection and education. Context: The community is located in the Poble Nou district, in Barecelona. An emerging neighborhood that is currently experiencing rapid movement and asynchronous evolution. Barcelona is rich in culinary heritage and enjoys a vibrant food scene. However, like many urban areas, unhealthy food options are easily accessible and heavily marketed, leading to high rates diet-related illnesses. The community aims to address these issues by promoting healthy, sustainable food options and educating the public on the importance of nutrition. Current Situation: Among the many problems being faced by the community at the moment, the largest problem in hand is that of harmful convenience. Fast food and processed food are readily available and often cheaper than healthier options, making it difficult for individuals to make healthy choices. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the food industry, leading to closures and job losses, making it harder for people to access healthy food choices. Engagement & Limits: The community thrives on collectivism and shared values, with regular events and meetings to share ideas and collaborate on projects. They also engage with the public through social media and public events, such as community gardens mornings, farmers\u2019 markets and cooking classes. However, the community is limited by financial constraints and a lack of resources, which can make it difficult to implement some of their more ambitious ideas and reach a wider population. Theory of Change: The community\u2019s theory of change is to use their collective creativity and passion for food to promote healthy food choices and lifestyles. They aim to achieve this by providing education on the importance of nutrition, organizing events to promote healthy food options, and collaborating with other organizations to create sustainable food systems that make healthy choices more accessible and affordable. Design challenges: The need to create more sustainable food systems and the need to promote healthy food choices in an environment that heavily markets unhealthy options. Opportunities: Innovation and creativity, such as developing new recipes, creating new food-based businesses that promote healthy options, and experimenting with new technologies to improve food production in a sustainable way.","title":"Creative Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-ExtendedIntelligences/","text":"\u00b6 Extended Intelligences \u00b6 This brief course on AI and Extended Intelligences was really exciting and insightful.

Which worlds can we design with the power of todays tools? How can we design the transition towards these worlds? \u00b6 Sadly, perhaps the possible realities for the futures are not bright. Our current systems have created a complex web of forces which have been used to expand the power and influence of certain groups at the expense of others. Moreover, as automation takes over the world, there are raising concerns over the importance of critical thinking and conscious decision-making. If we do not address grand challenges like climate change, global inequality, and the threat of artificial intelligence responsibly and transparently, our future is at great risk. But what if we could transform individuals and empower people to create and demand regenerative products, services, spaces, and systems that support the health and wellbeing of people and the planet? This is where education, circular design and regenerative design come into play. By transforming and empowering individuals, designers can reconfigure systems of extraction towards new worlds of liberty, collectivism, and fulfillment. Across the evolution of humanity, systems have been designed to extract resources, time, attention, and anything that could be transformed into profits, creating a complex web of economic, military, and cultural forces. These systems have been used to expand the power and influence of certain groups at the expense of others. The harsh reality is that Capitalism and its systems of extraction are not just about exploiting people, but also about exploiting the environment. As described by Patel and Moore in their book \u201cThe History of the World in 7 Cheap Things,\u201d the cheapening of nature, work, food, energy, money, care, and lives have enabled the accumulation of wealth and power by a small group of elites. Extraction is not just an issue between societies but is also an issue that can also occur within them. The futures presented today are dictated by these characteristics, and there exists great risk in navigating scenarios where grand challenges like climate change, global inequality and the threat of artificial intelligence are not addressed responsibly and transparently because of these systems. Moreover, looking at the degree of perceived takeover of automation in the futures and all emerging AI powered applications, it becomes of even greater importance to transform individuals and empower the people making the decisions behind these automated futures. Critical thinking and conscious decision making are key qualities for tomorrow. The advancement of technology has enabled systems of extraction to exist with greater power. Today, open tools are available to collect, digest, and visualize data in ways that suggest detailed and accurate patterns of behavior. This power to manipulate behavior, and how easy we give out all of our data is often overlooked. We have little to no privacy in terms of our data, how our behavior is analyzed for the advantage of large institutions. Designers, and humans in general, must prioritize the implications of navigating futures where grand challenges like climate change, global inequality, and the threat of artificial intelligence are not addressed seriously and consciously. Not only this, I consider the futures at great risk if great individual transformation at a collective level is not attained. We must be willing and able to question the status quo and challenge unsustainable and harmful established power structures. We must all passionately dream of enjoying calmer, more fulfilling and harmonious lives. By transforming individuals and empowering people who make decisions that create realities, designers can reconfigure systems of extraction towards new worlds of liberty, collectivism, and regeneration. We can design and transition towards alternative economic systems that promote wellbeing, are based con cooperation, rather than competition, and prioritize the common of all human and non-human life. A world where we create and demand simple pleasure, peace, and joy for all. I\u2019m not suggesting going back to living free in nature, but rather reevaluate what is really happening in the world and take a step back to reframe evolution and our desired direction. To transform a system based on individuality, individual transformation must occur first. Awakening ~ or, regenerative education that is. As a precursor, designers need to explore and propose ways in which individual transformation can occur. That is, allowing people to heal and become empowered to create and demand regenerative products, services, spaces, and systems that support health and wellbeing of people and the planet. This transformation could allow a transition towards a new world where individuals prioritize regenerative practices and economic systems are designed to benefit the common good of all life. This transformation suggests the spark of new food systems that are healthy and accessible, new work dynamics that promote purpose and safety, more fulfilling and joyful days with quality time, relationships and love, and the acceptance of existence with gratitude. Designers can develop products and services that educate and inspire individuals to prioritize wellbeing and embrace regenerative practices, empowering them to demand sustainable solutions for a healthy and thriving world. As an example, I am developing education technology that can help people make better decisions to optimize their wellbeing by educating on Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV is a simple and practical way to connect with our nervous system, which is directly linked to our mental and physical health performance. By understanding our nervous states, we can explore ways to improve our wellbeing through sleep, holistic therapy, exercise, or nutrition, among many other techniques. By unlocking the power of this body of knowledge, we open the door to healing, regenerating, and thriving. HRV is a powerful seed of knowledge that can unlock curiosity towards understanding the dimensions of what it means to feel well. If we come to understand what our body is expressing and learn of ways in which we can better support its needs, then we can enjoy more time of feeling well and energized to engage with life. Another important aspect to consider as we come to propose new worlds as suggested is Circular Design. This approach aims to eliminate waste and pollution by keeping materials and products in use for as long as possible. In a fully realized circular economy, materials are continuously reused, and waste is minimized, resulting in a closed-loop system with minimal environmental impact. Innovations in technology and materials science could lead to more efficient resource use and new circular business models, such as product-as-a-service or shared ownership. Circular design could also become more integrated into mainstream design practices, with designers prioritizing resource efficiency and circularity as a key aspect of their work. Additionally, circular design could drive a shift in consumer behavior towards more sustainable choices, leading to a more conscious and responsible consumer culture. As an example, I come to imagine the potential behind the industrialization of bioplastics and of the closed loop systems in can promote within food systems. I also imagine what other ways we can generate value from what can be considered trash. As witnessed from a first person, great things can often be found in the dumpster. There obviously needs to be a change in consciousness about how we consume, and designers need to promote concepts that inspire mindful consumption. Another example of circularity is Biciclot, a garage in Poble Nou, Barcelona, which hosts a space for a community of cyclists for maintenance, repairs, and repurposing broken bikes to give them new life. This fantastic concept does not only promote a healthy and clean commuting activity, but also fosters a circular system for bikes parts and components. Regenerative design is another approach that could prove valuable in our transition towards safer, joyful, and meaningful systems of coexistence. Designing for regeneration is to design products, systems, spaces and buildings that not only minimize negative impacts, but actively work to restore and improve the natural systems they depend on. It is an holistic approach to design that goes beyond the traditional sustainability approach of reducing harm and focuses on creating positive impact and regenerating environments. Designers can create buildings that generate their own energy, urban agriculture systems that provide food and green spaces for communities, and transportation systems that prioritize walking, biking, and public transit over private vehicles. Regenerative design can also foster healthier behavior for people by creating environments that support physical activity, social connection, and access to nature. This last aspect is by default a double agent regenerative; that means that designing for access to nature implies vitality and regeneration for both human and nature. By designing spaces that prioritize active transportation like walking and biking, designers can encourage people to engage in more physical activity and reduce their dependence on cars. Urban agriculture systems can also provide opportunities for people to connect with nature, access fresh produce, and engage in community building activities. Again, these activities are both beneficial and revitalizing for both human and non-human life. Furthermore, designing buildings that prioritize natural light and ventilation can improve indoor air quality and promote mental and physical wellbeing. By incorporating regenerative design principles, designers can create environments that support the health and wellbeing of both people and the planet. Fortunately, there is hope for a brighter future. While our current systems may seem daunting and complex, we have the power to transform and shift towards regenerative practices that prioritize the health and wellbeing of people and the planet. Through education and circular and regenerative design, we can empower individuals to demand and create products, services, and spaces that support a sustainable future. By reconfiguring systems towards a more collective and fulfilling approach, we can tackle grand challenges such as climate change, global inequality and the ego-driven mindset in a responsible and transparent way. We have the power to create a world that values both people and the planet. With our collective critical thinking and conscious decision-making, we can pave the way towards a vibrant and sustainable future.","title":"Making Sense"},{"location":"term2/02-MakingSense/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"term2/02-MakingSense/#making-sense","text":"","title":"Making Sense"},{"location":"term2/02-MakingSense/#how-can-design-reconfigure-systems-of-extraction-which-worlds-can-we-design-with-the-power-of-todays-tools-how-can-we-design-the-transition-towards-these-worlds","text":"Sadly, perhaps the possible realities for the futures are not bright. Our current systems have created a complex web of forces which have been used to expand the power and influence of certain groups at the expense of others. Moreover, as automation takes over the world, there are raising concerns over the importance of critical thinking and conscious decision-making. If we do not address grand challenges like climate change, global inequality, and the threat of artificial intelligence responsibly and transparently, our future is at great risk. But what if we could transform individuals and empower people to create and demand regenerative products, services, spaces, and systems that support the health and wellbeing of people and the planet? This is where education, circular design and regenerative design come into play. By transforming and empowering individuals, designers can reconfigure systems of extraction towards new worlds of liberty, collectivism, and fulfillment. Across the evolution of humanity, systems have been designed to extract resources, time, attention, and anything that could be transformed into profits, creating a complex web of economic, military, and cultural forces. These systems have been used to expand the power and influence of certain groups at the expense of others. The harsh reality is that Capitalism and its systems of extraction are not just about exploiting people, but also about exploiting the environment. As described by Patel and Moore in their book \u201cThe History of the World in 7 Cheap Things,\u201d the cheapening of nature, work, food, energy, money, care, and lives have enabled the accumulation of wealth and power by a small group of elites. Extraction is not just an issue between societies but is also an issue that can also occur within them. The futures presented today are dictated by these characteristics, and there exists great risk in navigating scenarios where grand challenges like climate change, global inequality and the threat of artificial intelligence are not addressed responsibly and transparently because of these systems. Moreover, looking at the degree of perceived takeover of automation in the futures and all emerging AI powered applications, it becomes of even greater importance to transform individuals and empower the people making the decisions behind these automated futures. Critical thinking and conscious decision making are key qualities for tomorrow. The advancement of technology has enabled systems of extraction to exist with greater power. Today, open tools are available to collect, digest, and visualize data in ways that suggest detailed and accurate patterns of behavior. This power to manipulate behavior, and how easy we give out all of our data is often overlooked. We have little to no privacy in terms of our data, how our behavior is analyzed for the advantage of large institutions. Designers, and humans in general, must prioritize the implications of navigating futures where grand challenges like climate change, global inequality, and the threat of artificial intelligence are not addressed seriously and consciously. Not only this, I consider the futures at great risk if great individual transformation at a collective level is not attained. We must be willing and able to question the status quo and challenge unsustainable and harmful established power structures. We must all passionately dream of enjoying calmer, more fulfilling and harmonious lives. By transforming individuals and empowering people who make decisions that create realities, designers can reconfigure systems of extraction towards new worlds of liberty, collectivism, and regeneration. We can design and transition towards alternative economic systems that promote wellbeing, are based con cooperation, rather than competition, and prioritize the common of all human and non-human life. A world where we create and demand simple pleasure, peace, and joy for all. I\u2019m not suggesting going back to living free in nature, but rather reevaluate what is really happening in the world and take a step back to reframe evolution and our desired direction. To transform a system based on individuality, individual transformation must occur first. Awakening ~ or, regenerative education that is. As a precursor, designers need to explore and propose ways in which individual transformation can occur. That is, allowing people to heal and become empowered to create and demand regenerative products, services, spaces, and systems that support health and wellbeing of people and the planet. This transformation could allow a transition towards a new world where individuals prioritize regenerative practices and economic systems are designed to benefit the common good of all life. This transformation suggests the spark of new food systems that are healthy and accessible, new work dynamics that promote purpose and safety, more fulfilling and joyful days with quality time, relationships and love, and the acceptance of existence with gratitude. Designers can develop products and services that educate and inspire individuals to prioritize wellbeing and embrace regenerative practices, empowering them to demand sustainable solutions for a healthy and thriving world. As an example, I am developing education technology that can help people make better decisions to optimize their wellbeing by educating on Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV is a simple and practical way to connect with our nervous system, which is directly linked to our mental and physical health performance. By understanding our nervous states, we can explore ways to improve our wellbeing through sleep, holistic therapy, exercise, or nutrition, among many other techniques. By unlocking the power of this body of knowledge, we open the door to healing, regenerating, and thriving. HRV is a powerful seed of knowledge that can unlock curiosity towards understanding the dimensions of what it means to feel well. If we come to understand what our body is expressing and learn of ways in which we can better support its needs, then we can enjoy more time of feeling well and energized to engage with life. Another important aspect to consider as we come to propose new worlds as suggested is Circular Design. This approach aims to eliminate waste and pollution by keeping materials and products in use for as long as possible. In a fully realized circular economy, materials are continuously reused, and waste is minimized, resulting in a closed-loop system with minimal environmental impact. Innovations in technology and materials science could lead to more efficient resource use and new circular business models, such as product-as-a-service or shared ownership. Circular design could also become more integrated into mainstream design practices, with designers prioritizing resource efficiency and circularity as a key aspect of their work. Additionally, circular design could drive a shift in consumer behavior towards more sustainable choices, leading to a more conscious and responsible consumer culture. As an example, I come to imagine the potential behind the industrialization of bioplastics and of the closed loop systems in can promote within food systems. I also imagine what other ways we can generate value from what can be considered trash. As witnessed from a first person, great things can often be found in the dumpster. There obviously needs to be a change in consciousness about how we consume, and designers need to promote concepts that inspire mindful consumption. Another example of circularity is Biciclot, a garage in Poble Nou, Barcelona, which hosts a space for a community of cyclists for maintenance, repairs, and repurposing broken bikes to give them new life. This fantastic concept does not only promote a healthy and clean commuting activity, but also fosters a circular system for bikes parts and components. Regenerative design is another approach that could prove valuable in our transition towards safer, joyful, and meaningful systems of coexistence. Designing for regeneration is to design products, systems, spaces and buildings that not only minimize negative impacts, but actively work to restore and improve the natural systems they depend on. It is an holistic approach to design that goes beyond the traditional sustainability approach of reducing harm and focuses on creating positive impact and regenerating environments. Designers can create buildings that generate their own energy, urban agriculture systems that provide food and green spaces for communities, and transportation systems that prioritize walking, biking, and public transit over private vehicles. Regenerative design can also foster healthier behavior for people by creating environments that support physical activity, social connection, and access to nature. This last aspect is by default a double agent regenerative; that means that designing for access to nature implies vitality and regeneration for both human and nature. By designing spaces that prioritize active transportation like walking and biking, designers can encourage people to engage in more physical activity and reduce their dependence on cars. Urban agriculture systems can also provide opportunities for people to connect with nature, access fresh produce, and engage in community building activities. Again, these activities are both beneficial and revitalizing for both human and non-human life. Furthermore, designing buildings that prioritize natural light and ventilation can improve indoor air quality and promote mental and physical wellbeing. By incorporating regenerative design principles, designers can create environments that support the health and wellbeing of both people and the planet. Fortunately, there is hope for a brighter future. While our current systems may seem daunting and complex, we have the power to transform and shift towards regenerative practices that prioritize the health and wellbeing of people and the planet. Through education and circular and regenerative design, we can empower individuals to demand and create products, services, and spaces that support a sustainable future.

We have the power to create a world that values both people and the planet. With our collective critical thinking and conscious decision-making, we can pave the way towards a vibrant and sustainable future.","title":"How can design reconfigure systems of extraction?

It was an interesting exercise to continue understanding the basics of electronics and coding using Arduino. I worked on the board schematics, taking into consideration the different components and how they would work together to create sound. The simple setup incorporates a path to ground and another path for the output to pin 13 of the Adafruit Feather. I made use of different repositories online to find the right board pieces and code that would work for my project. As a result, the device managed to play the Star Wars theme. The repository I used for the StarWars buzzer tone is one by AbhishekGosh. ( https://github.com/AbhishekGhosh/Arduino-Buzzer-Tone-Codes/blob/master/star-wars.ino ). It was a simple but surprisingly fun exercise in understanding how hardware and software can work together to create a functional device. No.2 // Design Tools \u00b6 For the next micro-challenge, we were tasked to parametrize a croissant and also to create a 3D design based on algorithmic thinking of any object or concept. For the parametric croissant design, I decided to do a hand sketch. The sketch parametrizes 2 diferent triangle sizes and uses a total of 9 triangles that combine to give shape to the croissant from a top view. Here is the result: Next, for the 3D design based on algorithmic thinking of any concept, I decided to design a parametric bench. Although we received a great and insightful presentation about digital tools and programs for 2D, 3D, parametric and generative design, I would have liked to receive more classes, instructions, guidance or support to actually use these tools. Unlike some of my other classmates in MDEF, I have no previous experience on using these tools and had to start with the basics. I followed the instructions of a Youtube video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKnybai4gs ) on parametric modeling for a bench. It was an interesting exercise to learn about Rhino and the functions for Loft and Contoue, as well as some of the other basic functions of the tool. I enjoyed this exercise and learned to become more comfortable with Rhino. I imagine this bench to be composed of a number of wooden frames. Here is the result: Parametric Bench by Antonio Heinemann No.3 // 2D Fabrication \u00b6 For this assignment, we were tasked to create a parametric model and print it using a laster cutter. Although I had some initial ideas to create a laser-cut chess board, I did not have enough time to do so and had to invest my resource in working towards completing the challenge no.1. Here, there were two concepts that I fabricated. For the challenge, together with Dhriti, we created a sculpture that illustrates in a visually attractive format an important metric about how our bodies respond to different stimuli (more on this on the Challenges section of my site). For the sculputre, there were two important fabrications: (1) the wooden base to hold acrillic panes, and (2) a rastler engraving on the acrillic panes with a spiraled sphere design. We made the designs on Rhino. Here are the results: 2D Fabrication by Antonio Heinemann No.4 // Inputs + Outputs \u00b6 For the next micro-challenge, we were tasked to design a system of inputs and outputs using Arduino that uses an LDR sensor, a button, an LED to create a telegram. In this system, the button turns on an LED while pressed, and turns it off while unpressed. Then, the LDR sensor detects when there is light. Although the assignment suggestion was to work in pairs using two separate boards, for time efficiency reasons I decided to design the system using a single board and to complete the assignment by myself. Using the LDR readings, the system would identify if the light was on for a short period of time, or for an extended period of time. This would represent the equivalent of a dot (.) or dash (-) in morse code. Then, I programmed variables for each letter in Morse, and got the system to identify a few letters. I got stuck on the part where I had to concatenate the sensor data in order to actually identify all letters. I only managed the code to recognize letters E and T, which consist only of a dot (.) and a dash (-) respectively. Although I did not manage to successfully create the telegram, which was a rather complex exercise, the challenge was really exciting and I enjoyed working on this project a lot. Morse Code by Antonio Heinemann by Antonio Heinemann No.5 // Networking \u00b6 For this challenge, we were tasked to connect our Feathers to wifi using a MQTT broker and NodeRed. I completely forgot to document this excercise in class, and due to the MQTT credentials and the broker that we used (SmartCitizen), I could not replicate the excercise on my own. I could only provide the code file and some screenshots of the Arduino IDE. Basically, we managed to setup a communication network where we could send and receive messages from one device to another using this system. It was a simple exercise but it turned out to be extremely valuable to be able to complete and give robustness to our second prototype of the HRV sculpture which connected over Wifi. No.6 // 3D Printing \u00b6 The next assignment involved building knowledge on 3D printing and scaning. We were tasked to 3D print an object, and then to scan the final product. One of my planters recently broke, and so I decided to create a new planter to provide a space for one of my plants to sustain life. This little fellow was actually starting to die where I was keeping it, and very much appreciated my creation. Since I have little experience and knowledge on 3D modeling, I decided to download a premaid design by Stammchiller through MultiMaker\u2019s Thingverse ( https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4826953 ). I opened the file in Cura and made sure it would print accordingly. After printing and using it, I noticed that it could actually benefit from some improvements, such as an easier way to remove the top piece from the bottom piece, as well as a broader space between the bottom holder and the draining holder, since the holes are so close to the bottom holder, the draining feature is not really working at all. Still, the succulent that lives in this little planter can resist a bit more humidity and will not be affected if it is too wet. The printing process was exciting, this was the first time I have 3D printed something and I have loved doing so. I am excited to print more things and explore the potential behind this magnificent tool. For future iterations, I will definitely become more involved with the design process and use my new knolwedge on 3D modeling to create more efficient and functional products. The scanning aspect to the assignment was really exciting as well. I am fascinated by the idea of translating physical objects into the digital space. The digital interaction of scans is fun and entertaining. I discovered Polycam, a 3D scanning application, and used it for the assignment and have also used it in other situations as well. I learned that you can use it to scan textures, as explored frequently by Marc. I learned that scanning small and detailed objects can be a challenge, and also the lighting, shadowing, and location of scanning has a lot of impact on the quality of the scan. I did not really achieve a high quality scan of the planter with the plant inside. I tried multiple iterations but perhaps I need better lighting and equipment for the scan. In the lab there is a device that rotates on a circle which allows us to capture the entire 360 degree view of objects, but not having such a device at home made it a challenge. These are the results: 3D Printing by Antonio Heinemann 3D Scanning by Antonio Heinemann No.7 // Interfaces + Machines \u00b6 For this micro-challenge, we were tasked to use our previous knowledge on networks and integrate new insights around interfaces to power an LED using the Breathe or Blink functionalities by selecting either through an interface. Interfaces + Machines by Antonio Heinemann Networks + Interfaces by Antonio Heinemann No.8 // CNC \u00b6 For the final micro-challenge, we were tasked to use the CNC milling machine to craete something of our choice. Although my original plans were to build and create a chair, I only managed to have enough time to make the desing sketches and begin with the 3D modeling of it. I am still on the process of this design, and will complete it in the following weeks. Stay posted for the results! Here are some pictures of the sketches for the chair. Yet, we did manage to use the CNC machine and worked with some designs with Dhriti for our second challenge. Different from our first prototype, which had a base made out of a bioplastic using coffee waste, we created a beatiful base for the acrillic panes using the CNC. The result was amazing and I am exciting to use the CNC machine again. Here are some pictures of the process and the result. Big credits to Dhriti on this part of the challenge as the design was on great part a production of hers.","title":"Digital Prototyping for Design"},{"location":"term2/03-PrototypingforDesign/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"term2/03-PrototypingforDesign/#digital-prototyping-for-design","text":"","title":"Digital Prototyping for Design"},{"location":"term2/03-PrototypingforDesign/#no1-basic-ec","text":"For this assignment, we learned how to activate a buzzer to produce sound.

One of my planters recently broke, and so I decided to create a new planter to provide a space for one of my plants to sustain life. This little fellow was actually starting to die where I was keeping it, and very much appreciated my creation. Since I have little experience and knowledge on 3D modeling, I decided to download a premaid design by Stammchiller through MultiMaker\u2019s Thingverse ( https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4826953 ). I opened the file in Cura and made sure it would print accordingly. After printing and using it, I noticed that it could actually benefit from some improvements, such as an easier way to remove the top piece from the bottom piece, as well as a broader space between the bottom holder and the draining holder, since the holes are so close to the bottom holder, the draining feature is not really working at all. Still, the succulent that lives in this little planter can resist a bit more humidity and will not be affected if it is too wet. The printing process was exciting, this was the first time I have 3D printed something and I have loved doing so. I am excited to print more things and explore the potential behind this magnificent tool. For future iterations, I will definitely become more involved with the design process and use my new knolwedge on 3D modeling to create more efficient and functional products. The scanning aspect to the assignment was really exciting as well. I am fascinated by the idea of translating physical objects into the digital space. The digital interaction of scans is fun and entertaining. I discovered Polycam, a 3D scanning application, and used it for the assignment and have also used it in other situations as well. I learned that you can use it to scan textures, as explored frequently by Marc. I learned that scanning small and detailed objects can be a challenge, and also the lighting, shadowing, and location of scanning has a lot of impact on the quality of the scan. I did not really achieve a high quality scan of the planter with the plant inside. I tried multiple iterations but perhaps I need better lighting and equipment for the scan. In the lab there is a device that rotates on a circle which allows us to capture the entire 360 degree view of objects, but not having such a device at home made it a challenge.

Although my original plans were to build and create a chair, I only managed to have enough time to make the desing sketches and begin with the 3D modeling of it. I am still on the process of this design, and will complete it in the following weeks. Stay posted for the results! Here are some pictures of the sketches for the chair. Yet, we did manage to use the CNC machine and worked with some designs with Dhriti for our second challenge. Different from our first prototype, which had a base made out of a bioplastic using coffee waste, we created a beatiful base for the acrillic panes using the CNC. The result was amazing and I am exciting to use the CNC machine again. Here are some pictures of the process and the result.

We discussed the wisdom that our bodies hold, and their constant expression of feeling. It is important to listen to our bodies and follow what they desire if we want to enjoy living well. So, we decided to prototype a biofeedback device that aids in understanding information that our nervous systems are transmitting so as to provide tools to improve wellbeing. We thought, what if we can visualize clearly what our nervous system is expressing? Can this help us to control our bodily states and the way our minds interpret existence? We decided to explore this concept by building a model that visualizes Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV is the amount of time between heartbeats, which vary constantly depending on the state of balance of the nervous system. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are competing against each other, and the result from this balancing equation provides a value in ms. A higher value usually indicates a more balanced nervous system, while a lower value might indicate that one either sympathetic or parasympathetic system is dominating. This is expected while exercising, for instance, but might not be beneficial while sleeping. Since it is highly influenced by our nervous system, this implies that HRV represents valuable information transmitted to our brain on how our bodies should react to the stimuli it is exposed to. This could include the environment we are in, what we are feeling, what we are thinking, the people around us or the activities we engage in. There are many other types of biofeedback data that could also be considered, but we understand that HRV is easy to measure and provides comprehensive information. If we could visualize HRV in real time, can we learn how to achieve balance? By collecting heart rate data from ECG sensors, calculating HRV of a user, and visualizing this information in an engaging format, we could allow users to understand their bodily states and redirect them towards states of higher benefit.
