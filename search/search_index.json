It\u2019s in the beginning where identity, purpose and vision are aligned and pushed forwards. This journey of introspection and ideation requires courage and creativity. The AoWS deck was a useful instrument to put into words concepts that are often complex and hard to express. When encountering a word I did not know, the images on the cards opened a space for imagination and interpretation. Moreover, it was surprisingly interesting how easy it was to use the cards to have deep conversations about topics that move something inside us. Creating a design space after this synthesized the entire knowledge acquired across the week; it was a surreal life exercise. I was deeply moved by Mariana, her kindness and joyful excitement about MDEF. For reasons I can\u2019t fully comprehend I was touched by hearing her personal story. Perhaps I connected personally with some of the feelings that she or others may have had to interact with in life. All I say is that I am grateful to be in this moment in life and learn from amazing human beings. I am grateful to be in this journey of self-exploration, creation and evolution. Narrowing down was a difficult task as I had many interests to explore. Yet, I managed to map three design areas: Health Natural and Sustainable Empowering Creation Design Space \u00b6 HEALTH \u00b6 Physical Emotional Mental Energetic I am interested in understanding those aspects that are most relevant in the health, specifically of humans. I am also interested in the health of all living beings, and of the planet, and so this topic could get much broader with time but for now my interests are purely human and anatomical. That is, how humans are interacting to topics such as disease, prevention, access, financing. Here, I am particularly interested in Diabetes and Renal Failure as well as understanding habits and thinking patterns inside the health spectrum. That is, what makes people action on their health? How can we re-imagine the relationship with our bodies in a more natural approach to health? The other side of the physical aspect is along the lines of Mental, Emotional and Energetic health. This involves understanding suffering, articulating it and working on liberation. A particular aspect I am interested inside this realm is that of ancestral conditioning and generational healing. Also, I am interested by understanding how neurological wiring frames our being and the importance of understanding this. All sort of ideas spark into mind with Health. Health Literacy Medical Devices Measuring as a means of understanding Functional Medicine Prevention before reaction Regenerative Health Food as Medicine Holistic Therapy Healing and Liberation NATURAL AND SUSTAINABLE \u00b6 Recycling and reutilization Reforestation Ingesting real and natural Regenerative design In this side of the design space, I draw inspiration from mother nature. Going back to the roots, to our ancestral origins of connecting with what is real and what provides sustainability for the future. Having been in close contact with nature throughout my life, a thing that truly saddens me is witnessing the destruction of sacred nature. Rivers, mountains, forests, species\u2026 All is destroyed in aims to survive and participate in this twisted world we live in. One aspect I take to heart is reforestation, having a strong passion to grow trees, funghi and ecosystems to give back to mother nature and improve the world through cleaner air. Also, given the importance of reusing plastics, I am also generating ideas of how to build on distributed design principles and plastic recycling to solve important problems. From building blocks, to other construction pieces, or really any sort of items, this concept is something that has great potential in rural futures. Finally, I am also interested in understanding the idea of ingesting real and natural. This means that what I am putting into my body is something that my body actually can process and contributes to better health. This also means that I am respecting mother nature in this process. EMPOWERING CREATION \u00b6 Open source innovation Design for impact Scalar Thinking Maker mindset Distributed design This is probably the vaguest side of the design space, since there are not a lot of ideas but a lot of feelings and aspired potential.

Hopefully, together and aligned towards making the world healthier, more sustainable and more creative. These words trigger something in me. They move me and inspire me to imagine ways of co-creating new futures. Of building amazing collective stories to inspire others to join on changing the world. Having such a strong passion for creating, I am interested in learning so much about making, ideation, design, and open-source innovation.

Role 1 - Experimental Component Test of specific hypothesis. Systematic variatons of prototype or context of use. Communication channels: Working to provide offgrid communities with a prepaid solar energy service required efficient communication. An explanation of the service was required, given that the technology was something new to this population and many questions needed to be answered. More importantly, we were required to provide efficient mass communications to reach numerous individuals simultaneously so as to comply with our expansion efforts. During this process, we were interested in learning which are the most effective channels that we could rely on for our communications. After initial research, we came up with four different proposals: Traditional posters and flyers at the point of sale. Participating in monthly COCODE (Mayor) meetings. Using the community PSA speakers. Sending flyers through kids at school. In this case, we outlined systematic variations of means of communication and measured which ones had a higher impact on communities energy use. We came to understand that people respected community authorities and that participating at the monthly meetings were most efficient because it generated word of mouth and a converstaion to move people to our points of sale. Still, complementary communication tools were required to fulfill all expectations. Role 2 - Means of Inquiry Open-ended exploration. Instrument to collect, record and measure phenomena. A new business model: The company I worked in engaged with a business model that provided customers with free maintenance and repairs for the prepaid solar systems. However, as the user base grew and our coverage expanded, the units began to surpass their life expectancy and a large number of batteries were failing. This really pushed any limits in terms of maintenance capacity, and our service levels dropped causing a steep incline in customer inactivity. That is, people were not using their prepaid units because they were not working properly due to battery issues. We were faced with a critical question: How can we provide maintenance to solar systems with a higher frequency while mantaining low operational costs? We designed a number of concepts based on field insights, and decided to test an MVP through a pilot/prototype. The new business model involved empowering shopkeepers with tools, knowledge, skills and incentives so that community users could receive a maintenance service at their shops. We then structured new community-based routes, instead of home-based routes. That would accelerate the time to respond upon the failure of a system, while simultaneously reducing operation costs, ultimately increasing user activity and rentability. In this particular scenario, we prototyped a new business model which involved the design of new processes, documentation, materials, scripts, vehicles, routes, training, software development, hardware development and all of the million details that are ingrained inside a business model. Through this project, set up a scenario where we not only tested this busines model prototype, but also dived deeply into the community which enabeled great learning about a great variety of phenomena. More importantly, we created a scenario to collect, record, observe and measure phenomena. Are users willing to go to the shops for maintenace repairs? Is user activity increasing through higher frequency repairs? How loyal are users to the brand? What is the size of the value being generated for users? What impact does the product have on the community? How is the brand empowering individuals in rural communities? Role 3 - Research Archetype Illustration or demonstration. Physical embodiment of research concept, understanding or design reseach space Diving into the deep: In order to understand better how to improve our product offering, we understood that simply talking to users was not enough. Even ethnographic observation had its limits and could not provide answers to critical questions. With this context in mind, I designed an experiment to understand how our users actually lived and through this, how our product interacted inside their lives. I packed my bags and travelled off the grid into a carefully selected community in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. There, I rented a small wooden shack from a shopkeeper where I stayed for three weeks to embody the purest user experience. I used the solar system every day, and lived through the same pain points that our users faced every day and night. Not only in technical specifications but also in feelings, routines, habits, relationships, dynamics and insights that can only be experienced. Both product and service aspects were refined following the insights from this research activity and user activity was improved. Role 4 - Vehicle for Inquiry Driver for the research director. Research contribution is tied to the process of crafting the artifacts. Although I have collaborated in the design and crafting of different products or services, I have never really approached this excerecise as a focused artefact for learning. This sparks different ideas to mind, however since I am interested in understanding how people interact with their own health I am conceptualizing a prototyping activity where a small group of individuals are observed while collectively creating a device for health improvement. By witnessing the process of prototyping, documenting it, analyzing it and learning from the process itself I could understand important and interesting aspects of how people interact with their health.","title":"02 Prototyping"},{"location":"term1/02-Prototyping/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"term1/02-Prototyping/#prototyping","text":"The diferent roles of prototyping, and examples of how I have used them in the past or how I intend to use them in the future.

It suggests that medicine is powerful and effective but should be taken in small doses and in particular circumstances, and promotes a strict diet and exercise regimen as an alternative pill.

This is an interesting concept to explore. That is: What are the true incentives in the health industry?

This is an interesting concept to explore. That is: What are the true incentives in the health industry? How can we ensure that pharmaceutical companies actually guarantee a mission for health and not for profit? What is the potential of gentle medicine? Can diet and exercise regimens have a greater impact than medicine? How powerful is prevention? How can bioplastics support a sterile ecosystem that depends on disposable products?","title":"Article / Discussion"},{"location":"term1/04-LivingWithYourIdeas/","text":"\u00b6 Living With Your Own Ideas \u00b6 What did you make? Why did it matter? Functional health considers diet and exercise as the keys to disease prevention and a life full of energy and possibilities. Yet, strict diet regimens and timed exercise are hard to follow and often require much greater than following a prescription. Even as a healthy person, I wanted to understand what it would feel like to be forced to highly structured healthy lifestyle. Moreover, I wanted to know what would happen if I attempt to understand my health by measuring it. So, I decided to understand what the day in the life looks like for a type 2 diabetic. Diabetes affects the body by affecting the production and the resistance of insulin, which plays a vital role in health and wellbeing. Mainly, this hormone allows glucose (sugar in the blood ) to enter our fat, muscles and liver allowing us to produce and store energy. When our insulin becomes affected we need to help the body regulate the levels of sugar in the blood and we can do this through a balanced diet and exercise. When this combination is not enough, sometimes it can be necessary to aid our body with additional insulin so that we can continue to live functional and happy lives. High blood pressure can often come hand in hand with diabetes, and is something to monitor regardless of health status. Rules of engagement: Diet Greens Low-carb Balanced No sugar No carbs No coffee Exercise 1 hour per day Regenerative habits Mindful breathing or meditating No smoking or drinking Measuring Myrto CGM Alerts (Prototyped version of a Dexcom glucose monitor + whatsapp alerts from a friend). Act upon alert to regulate blood sugar levels by eating or exercising. Instant glucose measurement Blood pressure measurement Perceiving and decoding stimuli Feelings or sensations Emotions Triggers Habits Thoughts It was an incredible experience, which I came to appreciate and enjoy with gratitude and awareness. I honestly believe that more awareness on health and chronic diseas is needed, and that more people should be aware of the different needs of diabetic patients. Living with a strict diet can be demanding and difficult, especially when living inside such a toxic system that\u2019s nurtured by sugar, highly processed foods, harmful fats and chemicals; a system that is not natural. During this experience, most of the shops or restaurants that I normally interacted with were not accessible and I had to seek alternatives (often spending or walking more). The same happened at a social level when I decided not to join some friends for a drink, or for anything at all. I find it critical to redesign our systems to become more natural and healthy for humans and the planet. To enjoy leisure, food and drink, work, or day to day living in a regenerative style that improves our wellbeing. Society ought to be more careful to not disregard the danger of normalizing a toxic system that harms our bodies and minds. I am not a fanatic of embedding technology into our bodies; I\u2019d much rather have nothing attached at all! Still, if this would allow me to live and feel better, I\u2019m all in. I find the concept of CGMs and Insulin Pumps fascinating, as they automate tasks and make life easier. Although I could not gain value from my prototyped CGM, having something attached to my body for more than 24 hours was really an experience. It is uncomfortable. It itches and sometimes really hurts. Taking it off was really painful as well, and some of the sealing glue remained unremovable. Although this was just a prototype, I can imagine what it means to live with technology embedded and insist that there is tremendous opportunity to improve wellbeing and help patients to live more comfortable with technology. This last remark also plays with the concept of a spectrum between peace and anxiety when measuring to understand. Sometimes, measuring can become an act of relief but other times it can become an act of control. During the exercise, I came to experience the fear of truly accepting an unwanted measurement. It\u2019s a rollercoaster of emotions and can surely affect anxiety levels. All in all, I found a direct relationship between physical health, mental health and the context we live in. The things we eat, the places we go, the habits we live with and how we react to our environment shapes our wellbeing. Our current systems are unsustainable in all dimensions and represent a ticking bomb towards more global chaos. It is critical to design safer and regenerative spaces, activities, relationships and environments for us to thrive in and coexist. What happens when you involve yourself? Things get personal! You face your fears and curiosities to greet them with open arms. There were so many feelings engrained to this process; pricking my finger, needles, sticky/uncomfortable tape, anxiety, isolation, disconnection, fear, peace, joy, comfort, gratitude. A lot of these feelings also had radical twists in short timespans, like before and after measuring my glucose or blood pressure. Not knowing if I may be indicating a health problem gives me fear and anxiety, but once I understand that I am healthy then I can enjoy life even more peaceful. New things that I never imagined also appeared in my head, a new universe that I had not yet discovered. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? Intensity, detail and perception increase. Having interviewed a number of diabetic patients in the past, terms like lancets, test stripes, CGM, pump\u2026 were a standard for every conversation. But there is actually a huge difference in listening \u201cI must prick my finger every night to measure my glucose levels, even if I use the CGM all day,\u201d and actually doing it yourself.

We decided to use the power motors and sensors to create device that knocks doors. That is, when a sensor detects that the door is closed, it will begin to knock. When the sensor detects that the door is open, the device will stop working. The idea behind the concept is humurous and intended to be a pranking device. In a more advanced prototype, this device could be used by kids when running around the block knocking on the neighbourhood doors. Building the device was really fun. We programmed in arduino, assembled a breadbord and configured the entire system together. The logic was simple ~ sensor:on > knock door. sensor:off > stop knocking. Not only the electronics and programming aspect was entertaining, but also we created an actual door. Cutting wood and building things from nothing is truly a pleasure.

Perhaps the reason why reality is as is, and what could lie ahead is alarming and frightening, is that we are damaged as a human collective.
