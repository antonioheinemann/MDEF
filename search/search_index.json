I am a dreamer, a thinker, and a leader with immense desire to enable, to transform and to improve. To empower the collective and co-create a better world. I am a fan of beautiful, simple and functional design. I admire authenticity and humbleness. I respect people that walk their talk and live by love. My entire life has been a journey of understanding, expressing, and enjoying. Across this journey, I came to recognize that my purpose is centered around creation. Whether in art, in life, or in business, I feel a deep urge to participate in creative processes that generate value or beauty. Especially, projects of social impact and those that foster the wellbeing and enjoyment of humans.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/me/#about-me","text":"","title":"About Me"},{"location":"about/me/#antonio-heinemann","text":"Guatemala Purpose driven, sensible, powerful and courageous.

We got to know ourselves, our classmates and our surroundings all better as we begin to understand the context upon which we will be creating. The excitement is high. I really enjoyed going to different places around Poble Nou to get to know spaces, people and ideas which we will be interacting with. The way MDEf allows students to participate inside this wide ecosystem and inspire us make our ideas a reality is empowering. I am beginning to grasp the power of being a designer and the impact I can have for a healthier, more sustainable and conscious future. My vision: I dream that everyone, disregarding economic status, can enjoy basic health and education services. I dream of a world where health is safe, reliable, and convenient for all disregarding location or economic status. I dream that the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) has the tools, knowledge and capabilities to sustainabily co-create a new future filled with opportunities and dreams made true. I dream that future generations are educated in how to eat, exercise and live a healthy life. I dream that future generations will live by sustainable practices, honor and respect the planet and all inside it. I dream of an integrated digital global community. I dream that the youth in the BoP will change the world by becoming a powerhouse of value generation. I dream that people will live with consciousness, aware of the beauty of life and the importance of making the best of this great gift. I dream that humans contaminate less than they restore.","title":"01 Bootcamp"},{"location":"term1/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"This week was our first formal week of the program.

Time in motion as a driver for evolution. A dance, a movement, a spontaneous exgange of energy. I decided to use this symbol to express my Personal Development Plan for the master program. My knowledge, skills and attitude make waves that shape a spiral as it expands the person I dream to become in the future. I am excited to become the person I need to be in order to shape the future I envision.","title":"01 Vision"},{"location":"term1/01-Vision/#vision-and-identity","text":"I understand life as a Spiral in constant expansion.

It\u2019s in the beginning, where identity, purpose and vision are aligned forwards. This journey of introspection and ideation requires courage and creativity. The AoWS deck was a useful instrument to put into words concepts that are often complex and hard to express. When encountering a word I did not know, the images on the cards opened a space for imagination and interpretation. Moreover, it was surprisingly interesting how easy it was to use the cards to have deep conversations about topics that move something inside us. Creating a design space after this synthesized the entire knowledge acquired across the week; it was a surreal life exercise. I was deeply moved by Mariana, her kindness and joyful excitement about MDEF. For reasons I can\u2019t fully comprehend I was touched by hearing her personal story. Perhaps I connected personally with some of the feelings that she or others may have had to interact with in life. It has been hard for me to reflect and write on how this makes me feel, I am somehow overwhelmed. All I will share is that I am grateful to be in this moment in life and learn from amazing human beings. I am grateful to be in this journey of self exploration, creation and evolution. Narrowing down was a difficult task as I had many interests to explore. Yet, I managed to map three design areas: HEALTH \u2043 Physical \u2043 Emotional \u2043 Mental \u2043 Energetic NATURAL AND SUSTAINABLE \u2043 Recycling and reutilization \u2043 Reforestation \u2043 Ingesting real and natural \u2043 Regenerative EMPOWERING CREATION \u2043 Open source innovation \u2043 Design for impact \u2043 Scalar Thinking \u2043 Maker mindset \u2043 Distributed design","title":"02 AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-AoWS/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"This week has been one of the most profound moments until now.
