The AoWS deck was a useful instrument to put into words concepts that are often complex and hard to express. When encountering a word I did not know, the images on the cards opened a space for imagination and interpretation. Moreover, it was surprisingly interesting how easy it was to use the cards to have deep conversations about topics that move something inside us.

Perhaps I connected personally with some of the feelings that she or others may have had to interact with in life. All I say is that I am grateful to be in this moment in life and learn from amazing human beings. I am grateful to be in this journey of self-exploration, creation and evolution.

Here, I am particularly interested in Diabetes and Renal Failure as well as understanding habits and thinking patterns inside the health spectrum. That is, what makes people action on their health? How can we re-imagine the relationship with our bodies in a more natural approach to health? The other side of the physical aspect is along the lines of Mental, Emotional and Energetic health. This involves understanding suffering, articulating it and working on liberation. A particular aspect I am interested inside this realm is that of ancestral conditioning and generational healing.

Role 1 - Experimental Component Test of specific hypothesis. Systematic variatons of prototype or context of use. Communication channels: Working to provide offgrid communities with a prepaid solar energy service required efficient communication. An explanation of the service was required, given that the technology was something new to this population and many questions needed to be answered. More importantly, we were required to provide efficient mass communications to reach numerous individuals simultaneously so as to comply with our expansion efforts. During this process, we were interested in learning which are the most effective channels that we could rely on for our communications. After initial research, we came up with four different proposals: Traditional posters and flyers at the point of sale. Participating in monthly COCODE (Mayor) meetings. Using the community PSA speakers. Sending flyers through kids at school. In this case, we outlined systematic variations of means of communication and measured which ones had a higher impact on communities energy use. We came to understand that people respected community authorities and that participating at the monthly meetings were most efficient because it generated word of mouth and a converstaion to move people to our points of sale. Still, complementary communication tools were required to fulfill all expectations. Role 2 - Means of Inquiry Open-ended exploration. Instrument to collect, record and measure phenomena. A new business model: The company I worked in engaged with a business model that provided customers with free maintenance and repairs for the prepaid solar systems. However, as the user base grew and our coverage expanded, the units began to surpass their life expectancy and a large number of batteries were failing. This really pushed any limits in terms of maintenance capacity, and our service levels dropped causing a steep incline in customer inactivity. That is, people were not using their prepaid units because they were not working properly due to battery issues. We were faced with a critical question: How can we provide maintenance to solar systems with a higher frequency while mantaining low operational costs? We designed a number of concepts based on field insights, and decided to test an MVP through a pilot/prototype. The new business model involved empowering shopkeepers with tools, knowledge, skills and incentives so that community users could receive a maintenance service at their shops. We then structured new community-based routes, instead of home-based routes. That would accelerate the time to respond upon the failure of a system, while simultaneously reducing operation costs, ultimately increasing user activity and rentability. In this particular scenario, we prototyped a new business model which involved the design of new processes, documentation, materials, scripts, vehicles, routes, training, software development, hardware development and all of the million details that are ingrained inside a business model. Through this project, set up a scenario where we not only tested this busines model prototype, but also dived deeply into the community which enabeled great learning about a great variety of phenomena. More importantly, we created a scenario to collect, record, observe and measure phenomena. Are users willing to go to the shops for maintenace repairs? Is user activity increasing through higher frequency repairs? How loyal are users to the brand? What is the size of the value being generated for users? What impact does the product have on the community? How is the brand empowering individuals in rural communities? Role 3 - Research Archetype Illustration or demonstration. Physical embodiment of research concept, understanding or design reseach space Diving into the deep: In order to understand better how to improve our product offering, we understood that simply talking to users was not enough. Even ethnographic observation had its limits and could not provide answers to critical questions. With this context in mind, I designed an experiment to understand how our users actually lived and through this, how our product interacted inside their lives. I packed my bags and travelled off the grid into a carefully selected community in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. There, I rented a small wooden shack from a shopkeeper where I stayed for three weeks to embody the purest user experience. I used the solar system every day, and lived through the same pain points that our users faced every day and night. Not only in technical specifications but also in feelings, routines, habits, relationships, dynamics and insights that can only be experienced. Both product and service aspects were refined following the insights from this research activity and user activity was improved. Role 4 - Vehicle for Inquiry Driver for the research director. Research contribution is tied to the process of crafting the artifacts. Although I have collaborated in the design and crafting of different products or services, I have never really approached this excerecise as a focused artefact for learning. This sparks different ideas to mind, however since I am interested in understanding how people interact with their own health I am conceptualizing a prototyping activity where a small group of individuals are observed while collectively creating a device for health improvement. By witnessing the process of prototyping, documenting it, analyzing it and learning from the process itself I could understand important and interesting aspects of how people interact with their health.","title":"02 Prototyping"},{"location":"term1/02-Prototyping/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"term1/02-Prototyping/#prototyping","text":"The diferent roles of prototyping, and examples of how I have used them in the past or how I intend to use them in the future.

Why did it matter? Functional health considers diet and exercise as the keys to disease prevention and a life full of energy and possibilities. Yet, strict diet regimens and timed exercise are hard to follow and often require much greater than following a prescription. Even as a healthy person, I wanted to understand what it would feel like to be forced to highly structured healthy lifestyle. Moreover, I wanted to know what would happen if I attempt to understand my health by measuring it. So, I decided to understand what the day in the life looks like for a type 2 diabetic. Diabetes affects the body by affecting the production and the resistance of insulin, which plays a vital role in health and wellbeing. Mainly, this hormone allows glucose (sugar in the blood ) to enter our fat, muscles and liver allowing us to produce and store energy. When our insulin becomes affected we need to help the body regulate the levels of sugar in the blood and we can do this through a balanced diet and exercise. When this combination is not enough, sometimes it can be necessary to aid our body with additional insulin so that we can continue to live functional and happy lives. High blood pressure can often come hand in hand with diabetes, and is something to monitor regardless of health status. Rules of engagement: Diet Greens Low-carb Balanced No sugar No carbs No coffee Exercise 1 hour per day Regenerative habits Mindful breathing or meditating No smoking or drinking Measuring Myrto CGM Alerts (Prototyped version of a Dexcom glucose monitor + whatsapp alerts from a friend). Act upon alert to regulate blood sugar levels by eating or exercising. Instant glucose measurement when waking up before meals before going to bed Blood pressure measurement when waking up during the day before going to bed Perceiving and decoding stimuli Feelings or sensations Emotions Triggers Habits Thoughts It was an incredible experience, which I came to appreciate and enjoy with gratitude and awareness. I honestly believe that more awareness on health and chronic diseas is needed, and that more people should be aware of the different needs of diabetic patients. Living with a strict diet can be demanding and difficult, especially when living inside such a toxic system that\u2019s fundamented on sugar, highly processed foods, harmful fats and chemicals; a system that is not natural. During this experience, most of the shops or restaurants that I normally interacted with were not accessible and I had to seek alternatives (often spending or walking more). The same happened at a social level when I decided not to join some friends for a drink, or for anything at all. I find it critical to redesign our systems to become more natural and healthy for humans and the planet. To enjoy leisure, food and drink, work, or day to day living in a regenerative style that improves our wellbeing. Society ought to be more careful to not disregard the danger of normalizing a toxic system that harms our bodies and minds. I am not a fanatic of embedding technology into our bodies; I\u2019d much rather have nothing attached at all! Still, if this would allow me to live and feel better, I\u2019m all in. I find the concept of CGMs and Insulin Pumps fascinating, as they automate tasks and make life easier. Although I could not gain value from my prototyped CGM, having something attached to my body for more than 24 hours was really an experience. It is uncomfortable. It itches and sometimes really hurts. Taking it off was really painful as well, and some of the sealing glue remained unremovable. Although this was just a prototype, I can imagine what it means to live with technology embedded and insist that there is tremendous opportunity to improve wellbeing and help patients to live more comfortable with technology. This last remar also plays with the concept of a spectrum between peace and anxiety when measuring to understand. Sometimes, measuring can become an act of relief but other times it can become an act of control. During the exercise, I came to experience the fear of truly accepting an unwanted measurement. It\u2019s a rollercoaster of emotions and can surely affect anxiety levels. All in all, I found a direct relationship between physical health, mental health and the conext we live in. The things we eat, the places we go, the habits we live with and how we react to our enviroment shapes our wellbeing. Our current sysytems are unsustainable in all dimensions and represnt a ticking bomb towars more global chaos. It is critical to design safer and regenerative spaces, activities, relationships and environments for us to thrive in and coexist. What happens when you involve yourself? Things get personal! You face your fears and curiosities to greet them with open arms. There were so many feelings engrained to this process; pricking my finger, needles, sticky/uncomfortable tape, anxiety, isolation, disconnection, fear, peace, joy, comfort, gratitude. A lot of these feelings also had radical twists in short timespans, like before and after measuring my glucose or blood pressure. Not knowing if I may be indicating a health problem gives me fear and anxiety, but once I understand that I am healthy then I can enjoy life even more peaceful. New things that I never imagined also appeared in my head, a new universe that I had not yet discovered. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument?

The learning is much more profound and stimulating. Did anything change about your way of working? What does it mean for your future work? Yes.

Why did it matter? Functional health considers diet and exercise as the keys to disease prevention and a life full of energy and possibilities. Yet, strict diet regimens and timed exercise are hard to follow and often require much greater than following a prescription. Even as a healthy person, I wanted to understand what it would feel like to be forced to highly structured healthy lifestyle. Moreover, I wanted to know what would happen if I attempt to understand my health by measuring it. So, I decided to understand what the day in the life looks like for a type 2 diabetic. Diabetes affects the body by affecting the production and the resistance of insulin, which plays a vital role in health and wellbeing. Mainly, this hormone allows glucose (sugar in the blood ) to enter our fat, muscles and liver allowing us to produce and store energy. When our insulin becomes affected we need to help the body regulate the levels of sugar in the blood and we can do this through a balanced diet and exercise. When this combination is not enough, sometimes it can be necessary to aid our body with additional insulin so that we can continue to live functional and happy lives. High blood pressure can often come hand in hand with diabetes, and is something to monitor regardless of health status. Rules of engagement: Diet Greens Low-carb Balanced No sugar No carbs No coffee Exercise 1 hour per day Regenerative habits Mindful breathing or meditating No smoking or drinking Measuring Myrto CGM Alerts (Prototyped version of a Dexcom glucose monitor + whatsapp alerts from a friend). Act upon alert to regulate blood sugar levels by eating or exercising. Instant glucose measurement when waking up before meals before going to bed Blood pressure measurement when waking up during the day before going to bed Perceiving and decoding stimuli Feelings or sensations Emotions Triggers Habits Thoughts It was an incredible experience, which I came to appreciate and enjoy with gratitude and awareness. I honestly believe that more awareness on health and chronic diseas is needed, and that more people should be aware of the different needs of diabetic patients. Living with a strict diet can be demanding and difficult, especially when living inside such a toxic system that\u2019s fundamented on sugar, highly processed foods, harmful fats and chemicals; a system that is not natural. During this experience, most of the shops or restaurants that I normally interacted with were not accessible and I had to seek alternatives (often spending or walking more). The same happened at a social level when I decided not to join some friends for a drink, or for anything at all. I find it critical to redesign our systems to become more natural and healthy for humans and the planet. To enjoy leisure, food and drink, work, or day to day living in a regenerative style that improves our wellbeing. Society ought to be more careful to not disregard the danger of normalizing a toxic system that harms our bodies and minds. I am not a fanatic of embedding technology into our bodies; I\u2019d much rather have nothing attached at all! Still, if this would allow me to live and feel better, I\u2019m all in. I find the concept of CGMs and Insulin Pumps fascinating, as they automate tasks and make life easier.
